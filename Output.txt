Male:85.13%, Male, we get back to the ship and find that dad is feeling somewhat better, and he joins us for dinner. our next stop will be cozumel, and felix, our waiter, recommended stopping off at carlos'n charlie's, the local party bar. he told us that generally, by 3:00 pm or so, the girls start losing their tops, and the party continues on. he told us that the free tequila flows most of the day. well, that was enough for us! we scatter, and meet again at dizzy's for a little more jazz, and a final nightcap. little did we know that the shit was once again going to hit the fan in the morning...
Male:85.10%, Male, the pokéwalker is pokemon soul silver and heart gold's gimmick; a pedometer that records your steps and allows you to build up your pokémon, capture additional pokémon and find items.over at bulbapedia they've determined that to unlock everything the pokéwalker has to offer, it's going to take 1,000 miles of walking. who needs to do that, when you can flat out cheat instead?after some closed-laboratory experiments in my apartment and some field tests, we've determined some effective ways to trick the pokéwalker into thinking you've been walking:

Female:100.00%, Female, i borrowed this dress from my roommate. it is typical american apparel, which means it is pretty comfortable and looks good. it's perfect for those mornings when i have to rush to my 8am class. i got this shirt about two years ago at a thrift store. it is the perfect shirt for spring. today was the first warm day since i've been back in vermont. spring is certainly on it's way. 
Female:100.00%, Female, we've been on 2 disney cruises and going on our 3rd next month. they are just great. there is always so much to do or you can do nothing. i like the 'doing nothing' part. i go and sit at quiet cove pool-the adults only pool-with a drink with an umbrella in my hand and bask in the sun. there is nothing better than that. all the cast members are so great and helpful. room service is great too!!!! it's just so nice to sit in your room or on your verandah and eat while watching the ocean sail away. we always have a catagory 7 state room so we have a verandah.
Female:100.00%, Female, n june my husband and i took a trip through the grand tetons national park and to yellowstone national park. my husband had always wanted to go there, and while i was fine with our destination, i wasn't necessarily all that excited about it. what a blessing it was to go there! i was absolutely amazed and awestruck by the beauty and grandeur of these parks. we stayed in west yellowstone montana at the holiday inn sunspree resort while we toured yellowstone. it was wonderful. 
Male:99.73%, Male, "the mis-education of the negro", by carter g. woodson. this is going to be a great book and will make for a great topic of discussion in our next meeting. in my opinion this is a must read for all african americans. it will bring insight into a lot of issues that plight us as a people. and what you will find even more interesting is that this book was published in 1933 but still incredibly relevant to the problems we face today almost 80 years later. 
Male:80.60%, Male, so shall i be river letting you flow through brook; like the lines of this poem, i let you paint the sky as blue or the streets of a certain town lazy while there in a brothel, a girl brothel, a girl without the keys of her self allows you the street you make a tone darker.

Male:90.72%, Female, i love continental airlines! they never disappoint me and i am so thrilled with their service. i travel a lot and i just have thumbs up for this outstanding airline. i recommend all travelers to go through continental airlines. they have great employees that are so professional and so caring for us travelers. i feel special and great traveling all the time through them. if i would use another airline, it would be because i am forced to if continental airlines didn't take me to my destination. there are many different ways to earn mileage in this airlines.
Female:99.92%, Male, we bought our lexus rx 300 here many years ago and then traded it in for the lexus rx 330 which i now drive. each and every time i have gone back to the dealership for service, they have been amazing. they are fast. they are efficient. they drive me to my office at no cost and then reimburse the cost of a cab when i come back. at the dealership they have a cafe with reading chairs, flat screens etc. and to top it all off, they give free car washes to their customers.
Female:100.00%, Male, my wife and i were thrilled that a few friends recommended we try out coast. easily accessible from 90/94, there was no corkage fee for the bottle of wine we brought in and the sushi was excellent. highly recommend the sunshine and volcano rolls in addition to the hamachi/jalapeno. also a huge fan of their spicy miso soup and spinach appetizers. we're going to make this at least a biweekly outing. 
Female:100.00%, Male, sebastian has down syndrome and requires more attention than most babies. among other things, he has to be fed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours, even through the night. mindy knew his parents could use a break. so she volunteered to hold him for a while. she sang him to sleep. mindy would be the first to tell you it's a god thing. yep! i think it's just beautiful! and so does little sebastian!
Female:99.98%, Female, ginger, my daughter-in-law, just sent me this photo of my grandbabies...ben and charlie. ben is a bit over 3 years and charlie's 7 months old. my cousin saw this photo...wrote me telling me it would be a good advertisement for cosco! aren't they so cute and sweet...it's about time for me to go for another visit! 
Female:100.00%, Male, am i the only one who finds atwood's writing the equivalent of a sunday roast? eagerly awaited and elegantly presented, you know that no matter which bit of the chicken you choose, you will always be satisfied. and any puns involving her novel 'the edible woman' are verboten. the roast potatoes will be crunchy, the greens will be soft and the yorkshire puddings will be well cooked. margaret is to me the epitome of a family gathering. i crave her writing style in the same way i crave my wife's roast dinners.
Male:91.41%, Male, experience tells me we need to take this, hopefully temporary, yard art to an appropriate specialist. in this case, that would be an auto-electric shop. experience has also taught me the damn thing needs to be running for them to do a diagnosis on it. i’ve been down that particular primrose path before. without their equipment, they have to examine the entire electrical system, a very expensive process, and hope like hell they get lucky. if they don’t get lucky, repair by replacement goes into operation – another very expensive process. two expensive processes do not equal an affordable bill.
Female:50.87%, Male, yet, after speaking of god’s intimate knowledge- he asks him to search him. he asks him to see things we normally want to hide from the almighty- anxious thoughts, offensive ways. yet, the psalmist knows what we all know- we cannot hide from god. so if we can’t hide from him, then we should ask his help to overcome our faults and weaknesses.
Female:98.87%, Female, first off, dw went as part of a leadership team from our denomination to assess how exactly to plant an orphanage(s). he was told before he left, that they knew that dw's appointment was a divine assignment because of all the orphanages he has been part of, volunteered at, and supported. they also loved that we have adopted 7 kids ourselves. {i love that part too
Female:100.00%, Female, sebryna has learned that when she does something naughty, my response is usually "noooo!". now i know when she has been naughty without even looking at her because she says it herself, "mommy, nooooooooo!." ....only it's much cuter because she makes her voice very dramatic with a nasally sound. (imagine someone yelling, "hellooooooo in therrrrre" like they're calling into a cave). so cute!!
Male:100.00%, Male, at nearly 19 feet long and dripping with what seems like 500 pounds of chrome, the cadillac escalade esv platinum is the biggest, glitziest, most conspicuously consumptive vehicle in general motors’ lineup. the stretched esv variant is almost 20 inches longer than the regular escalade, with the range-topping platinum package (available on both lengths) adding a new cts-inspired grille and front fascia, along with super-bright led headlights and unique 22-inch wheels.
Male:99.97%, Male, i am not the typical rpg gamer. i have never been a fan of the games where you pick your actions from a menu. this is a real-time rpg. it is wide open from the begining, although one might want to watch where they venture. high-level nasties, and locked doors may block your way. if you are a mage, dispatching the baddies will come easier. if you are a theif, you can take care of those pesky locks with ease. but, your class is not limited.
Male:97.75%, Male, i used to watch dr. who on pbs with my dad in the eighties. i am not into sci-fi at all. my dad is a trekkie and into the who series deeply. out of all his interests, i shared in dr. who simply because it was a series i could follow because it centered around time travel. time involves most of what we do so it was practical in a sense. we have wondered about the validity of the past, the future and how we apply the present. dr. who's cast involved real people who were relatable. in the area i live now, i was quite disappointed to find the local pbs doesnt air dr. who.
Male:96.09%, Female, this company is great. its a new company but its stock will truly show just how much. they have reached some high profit numbers. soon to be again, and steady! i look for metro to become more diverse and expect them to take on a nice share of the cellular market from the "big guys" and make it more affordable to all. 
Female:87.87%, Female, i just found a beautiful little book of quotes called "words of the spirit, thoughts to live by" they are compiled from discourses from para pujya ma. i am here in kathmandu and have brought my camera, though unfortunately, i am unable to use my usb port and have no card reader, so i will have to paint the pictures with my words for now.
Female:99.99%, Female, god spoke to my heart today. i have been in a season of change. it is much needed changed but it wasn't change i had control over which made me uncomfortable. so for the last 47 days of my life i have been seeking clarity and direction in my life. i have gone through so many different emotions and have questioned god over and over again. i prayed and prayed but weeks have gone by and nothing. nothing has changed in my situation. my days are long and unproductive. i have been completely unmotivated to do anything but the absolutely necessary. 
Female:63.52%, Male, i paid 100 bucks for this shirt. however, i'm now able to wear this thing to formal functions, instead of a suit and a tie. can you believe it? i can wear this to the symphony. i can wear this to weddings-i did today. i have to say that i have procrastinated in making what has become an obligatory purchase.
Male:52.08%, Male, we are still waiting to hear more details about the atm crooks. one thing that has the town abuzz is that the news reported on wednesday that they had confessions from four more guys, three of whom are 18. for some reason, the news has since blacked out and none of the three names have been made public.
Male:99.98%, Male,  alex chilton died today from a heart attack. for those of you who don't know who he was, he was one of the primary members of big star, a band i fell in love with only fairly recently. he wrote some of the most modern-sounding music from the early 70's, unfortunately, big star wasn't as large a commercial success as they deserved to be, releasing only three albums before a long break from recording as a band. it didn't help that their recording company didn't give them a fair break either.
Male:99.99%, Male, the big star of today's apple event in san francisco had to be the latest version of the ipod nano. chief amongst the music player's new features is a video camera placed on the bottom rear of the device.after the presentation, out editor-in-chief lance ulanoff managed to get some hands-on time with the new device on the show room floor. check out some more exclusive images of the new ipod nano after the jump. 
Female:99.50%, Female, so this morning i came in early to try to get some work done. but some of my colleagues had the same thoughts and came in as soon as i got my door open. sigh. then my internet did not seem to want to work. sigh. and my email was not responding. sigh. but now, as you can see, everything is back to normal, including the time.
Male:100.00%, Female, he mac mini has been a great replacement server for my old windows 2003 box. it performs like a champ and with little to no maintenance. i've had it running for over a year now (on 24/7 hosting several websites) and i have not had any problems. i upgraded the ram to 2 gig and other than that i haven't done a thing to it. i use a regular "pc" mouse, a mac wireless keyboard and a sony monitor. it is the only server on my network of 2 laptops and 2 pc's. i couldn't be happier with it and can't wait to upgrade to leopard! 
Male:93.99%, Male, alright. in order to finally complete my application, i tried another photo on istockphoto.com. this time it's from the food and beverage category. which is a wanted category of photographs as described in their tutorial or photo training manual. if that pic doesn't fly, i guess i need new camera equipment. as you probably guessed by now, my approach to istockphoto is this. "dude, you take thousands and thousands of photos every year, there must be some stock-worthy stuff in there."
Male:100.00%, Male, the is a reviewer favorite, and the iphone 3gs (the s stands for speed) receives accolades as well, although reviewers aren't quite as enthusiastic. available and 32 gb versions, the 3gs boasts an upgraded 600 mhz processor (up from 412 mhz) and 256 mb of ram, double that of the iphone 3g's 128 mb. testing by editors at mobiletechreview.com, pcmag.com and others shows that the 3gs is indeed noticeably faster in loading contacts, email, websites, games and various apps. other than circuitry upgrades, most of the improvements to the iphone 3gs are software-based, and many reviewers point out that current iphone 3g owners can simply download the iphone 3.0 software for free. nearly every reviewer recommends buying the new iphone only if you have the original iphone or haven't yet taken the iphone plunge. 
Male:99.99%, Male, the lounge (left) gives your iphone 3gs or 3g a place to recline, whether on your desktop or on a dashboard, so you can easily view the screen. its main use is with gps applications, but it's also handy when you want to watch a video. it lists for $49.99. 
Male:96.65%, Male, so, because of my last post, my wife finished both gary unmarried and the first season of frasier with me last night. enjoyed gary unmarried immensely. frasier is very on again/off again for me. some are hilarious, some are funny, and some are a waste of 22 minutes. the season ender for me was in the final category. it was nothing like the rest of the show, and for me was a failed experiment. 
Male:100.00%, Male, the 2010 winter olympics games are about to begin in vancouver, canada, and while it isn't the first olympics since the app store launched (it was a month old for the 2008 summer games), it will be the first to receive massive support from the iphone community. from tracking the winners, to virtual recreations of the events to apps crafted just for the athletes, the app store has plenty to offer, and these are some of the best:
Male:99.95%, Male, i am hoping against hope that president obama (i can't remember when i have to capitalize "president") can be successful, and not just because i'm a democrat. i am kind of tired to hear the same old opinions that the stimulus plan is too much spending, while at the same time not providing enough tax relief for the upper income brackets. can't anyone acknowledge that supply-side economics didn't work? 
Male:90.06%, Female, out of all the contact lens solutions available, clear care by ciba vision does the best job at keeping my contact lenses clean and comfortable. it's a hydrogen peroxide solution and really helps to remove any debris or deposits on my lenses. because my contacts are the kind that are replaced quarterly, it definitely helps keep my lenses feeling fresh even towards the time when i need to replace them. you do have to be careful though. it's not for rinsing your contacts and you can't put it in your eyes or you'll burn them.
Female:98.73%, Female, dr. mike examined me after i had been to 10 mds. these 10 others couldn't diagnose my illness and didn't seem to care. dr. mike could tell there was something really wrong and didn't want to treat me, but gave me some great advice as far as treatment i should receive. i followed that advice and am now being treated by a tremendous and brilliant md--one outside the system i had been in. i appreciate his care, concern, and professional advice. i'm doing much better now. 
Female:100.00%, Female, so i totally did the prescribed weight for women of 95#s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am really proud of me. like really, really really. it was tough. by round 5 i was mentally drained; i couldn't believe that i had 5 more rounds to do. what did i eat today? not much. i had scrambled eggs with parmesan cheese, bacon, and basil. a decaf latte.
Female:99.97%, Female, our family of 4 really enjoyed our cruise on disney cruise line's wonder ship. even though we went off-season and it rained almost every day, it was a vacation we'll never forget. the food was amazing and we felt like royalty every time we dined. the shows were awesome, especially for our kids who had never seen a live theatre production before. they also have very secure child care facilities that the kids just loved! they thought we were dropping them off to have some parent-free fun, not the other way around!
Female:99.97%, Male, oh i may have a few co-workers with me and i know that i will always have plenty to do while at my destination necessitating my businessness (oh yeah, i just made that up), but when all is said and done, the bed just isn't as warm without my wife next to me and my child relatively close.
Male:99.92%, Male, arrested development is undoubtedly the best sitcom of the 21st century, and it never even got a chance to win the hearts of america. this show had a wonderful blend of topical humor and dry wit. in its three seasons - from the pilot, which was extended and became the first episode, to the epilogue in the third season - arrested development delivered continuous laughs.
Female:99.43%, Female, i have to say that i really did love this bike, i owned one from 2002 to 2005! easy to handle and comfortable, with enough power to get me up the grades to mammoth!people thought i was riding a harley, lol.. i was so grateful that paid a fraction of what it would have cost me for a harley.great gas mileage, i rode it everywhere! with the weather in ca. and this bike. oh my, i was in heaven!
Female:100.00%, Female, after completing the tie i undertook the task of making 2 toddler ties for my sister-in-law tiara's wedding. i took apart a men's tie and was able to make 2 toddler ties. i think i could even make one bitty baby tie with the left over. anyway, i took apart one of davis' ties to use as a pattern. it was really easy. i may make a pattern.
Female:100.00%, Female, last week my girl's & i found out some very sad news. a cat friend of ours passed away. lou was my parent's pet & the girl's begged to take him home every time we visited. lou got very sick & had to be "put to sleep". last week my girl's & i found out some very sad news. a cat friend of ours passed away. lou was my parent's pet & the girl's begged to take him home every time we visited. lou got very sick & had to be "put to sleep".
Female:99.99%, Female, when i got off the plan in aruba i knew it was a different place from the others we had been to in the carribean. aruba has a constant breeze which makes the warm but not too warm weather even nicer! the water was beautifully calm and gorgeously blue. the food was good too! my husband and i burn easily and yet left after a week in aruba with out a red mark on us!!
Female:87.62%, Male,  precious the movie is a part 3 of a series that is dedicated to the faces of domestic violence. in part 1 of this series i began telling my friends sara's story that ivolved emotional and verbal abuse that began with eli's mother who yelled and screamed at eli and his dad. eventually this domestic abuse began its vicious cycle and transitioned from eli be abused by his mom to eli abuing sara, his wife. 
Female:92.60%, Female, wasn't sure whether we'd have a good experience after all the things i'd read in reviews about enterprise, but we got to the small regional airport late in the day on a thursday afternoon. the compact we had reserved was gone and so we were upgraded to a nissan murano, a nice suv (horrible gas mileage, though).the manager (only one person doing all the tasks) didn't write down a large scratch on the left rear bumper, and i made my husband go back in and have her identify it on her copy. 
Male:93.16%, Male, as days go, it doesn’t seem like a bad day. the sun is casting a golden glow on the branches of the cedar and spruce trees in the front yard. other than a couple of drifts created by shovel and blower, the snow has retreated to a few spots that will be shaded by trees for another few weeks. the temperature is balmy enough to make t-shirts a viable alternative to coats. like i said, as days go, it doesn’t seem bad.
Male:93.32%, Female, i have flown jetblue many times and i have never had a bad experience. i am a very frequent flyer, taking 100 or more domestic and international airlines trip a year, and i have flown most of the world's airlines, and i have to give jetblue my personal award for being number one, the best. at least in coach. i'm not saying that another airline's first class or business class is not better (although i have flown afew where jetblue's is superior to their premium service. but in general i'm only comparing coach to coach, and the general day to day operations of the airline.
Male:93.92%, Female, kathmandu, has changed very little since my last visit except that things are slightly more expensive and there is even less electricity and more garbage. people seem to have given up on the idea that government will be solving their problems any time soon. as a result, there are more electric generators at shops and restaurants.
Male:99.98%, Male, from mtv.com: "twilight" stars robert pattinson and peter facinelli have told mtv news that their ideal director for "breaking dawn," the still-announced adaptation of the final volume in the vampire series, would be two-time oscar-nominated director gus van sant. an entertainment weekly report on tuesday suggested that van sant ("milk") is in fact one of three high-profile directors who have been approached to helm the film, along with sofia coppola ("lost in translation") and bill condon ("dreamgirls").
Female:99.33%, Male, the way morgan searched for the right bmw was spiritual. finding a 2002 for two thousand two (hundred. it has connection to his mother's memory so when we drove to pick it up in monterey we also visited an artist friend of hers from high school (neutrer.) at the reunion julia reminded everyone (of how prolific jayne was) by the impressive style of dark outlines of playful imagry and we sat at the same table as josh reynolds so we could share trident stories . . in chicago!
Male:100.00%, Male, the next optimization technique, i will be demonstrating is a predicate pushing problem. unbeknownst to most developers, sql server 2005 does have a problem with predicate pushing in views. a lot of these issues have been resolved in sql server 2008, but should be known. i will be demonstrating a very simple example, using a ranking function. ranking functions are relatively new to sql server and were introduced in 2005. i am sure there are other scenarios that cause predicate pushing problems, but i will only be addressing the ranking problem, in this post.s
Male:100.00%, Female, if you're in the market for a new point-and-shoot digital camera, you don't have to spend an arm and a leg for a product that produces quality photos. according to wendy sheehan donnell, pcmag's managing editor for consumer electronics, if you're looking for a new digital camera, it's a great time to find a deal as vendors make room for newer models.sheehan donnell rounded up eight great digital cameras for under $200. for example, you can save 40 percent off of the canon powershot sd960 is. originally $329.99, the camera is on sale for $199.99 at bestbuy.com. the camera has a 16:9 lcd, which lets you frame your shots to match the format of hdtv and widescreen laptop displays. read the full review at pcmag.com. 
Female:93.16%, Female, when i travel, i always try to find a continental flight because i know that most of their flights are on-time and reliable. i also find their seats to be a little roomier. i recently flew american airlines because it was more convenient, but was surprised at how cramped the seats were! in an airplane, when traveling with a lap child (child under 2 traveling on my lap for free), every inch of space counts -- big time! we are very nearly always treated courtesly, although some of the flight attendants seem to be getting a little bit of an attitude, like "we're better and we know it". 
Male:100.00%, Male, most of sunbelt software's business lies in supplying malware protection to its 25,000 enterprise customers. sunbelt also licenses its engine and sandbox analysis software to other vendors. but the people at sunbelt are just as passionate about their consumer product, vipre antivirus 4.0 ($29.95 direct). vipre did well in testing, and it offers some bonus features more often found in suites than in standalone antivirus utilities. 
Female:54.12%, Male, this stuff is great; i found it through a friend and well never take aspirin again. not only is hyland a great company, the products that they offer are budget conscious and effective. it is not necessarily a great head ache cure but it does sooth my daily aches, when necessary. 
Female:99.98%, Female, many people fear the holidays because they are afraid of putting on a few extra pounds. some even turn down party and dinner invitations in hopes of avoiding any new bulges or rolls. however, holidays are the perfect time to touch base with family members and friends that you don’t see regularly throughout the year, so it is important not to let fears of gaining weight prevent you from having some holiday fun.
Male:99.64%, Male, in homo sapiens sapiens, that's certainly the case: men try to hoard women, preventing other men from getting access to them, and the morality of "rape" is more about keeping women secure and intact from other males than about respecting women's wishes or decisions. i've been annoyed, in the "evolutionary" discussions of rape i've seen so far, by their careful avoidance of the fact that in the real world, rape is not considered such a bad thing after all, that women are presumed be wanting it secretly, and that men are constantly trying to construct scenarios in which a woman forfeits her right to say no.
Male:98.77%, Male, as one of the freshest and most interesting videogame franchises today, bioshock is 100% definitely going to get ruined by 2k. bioshock is loved for its amazing setting that will soon be stripped of all mystique and thought-provoking story and continually ret-conned into sterility. who can forget their first moment they ran into a big daddy, a videogame character who will be marketed until you can't remember why you liked him in the first place?soon bioshock will too join the ranks of innovative franchises such as splinter cell and guitar hero which are now unbearable to even look at. here's now:

Male:74.65%, Male, to find classic car insurance quotes you should use the internet. this helps to speed things up quite a bit. in other words, you don't have to sit back and wait for an agent or broker to call you back. instead, you are in charge and taking the initiative. how does that sound to you?
Female:96.68%, Male, way back in the 1990s i was at supercuts one day and the tweeker girl doing my buzz cut became fascinated with my irish heritage and how that related to my sparse-but-there body hair. are you irish? she asked. i'm not from ireland, i replied, but my ancestors were. 
Male:87.46%, Female, it is progress! if possible, i would like to visit the school when i go to nepal in march and make a contribution to their operating expenses. i would also like to arrange a letter exchange with some of our local school students. but, i will have to wait and see how the plan unfolds. travel restrictions, strikes, and weather can make it difficult to get to rural areas of nepal, and someone would have to offer to host me in their home. with only a two week travel plan, i may not be able to get there and back. if i do get there, i'll bring you pictures and stories. in february, i will be giving a free lecture on 'life and work in nepal during difficult times.' i will discuss the effects of 911 on nepal, the murder of the entire nepalese royal family, endless annual strikes, and the maoist revolution. the lecture will be held at the plymouth ucc in shaker heights, oh. sunday february 14th, 9:30 - 10:20 am in room 102.
Female:99.78%, Female, i want to run. to live. to live, every day. to see the world as full of beauty as it is. i don't want to surround myself with people who wonder why they exist. who can't see the beauty; who don't see the purpose of it. i want to feel like dancing at my memories, dancing for my future, dancing in the moment. i want to giggle when i have no explanation for why.
Male:97.29%, Female, the mughals had a dress code and would not wear the pant/shirt cause mostly non-believers would wear them. however, now a days even our so-called islamically established states have the concept of the western pant/shirt deeply engraved in their societies. so what now? what do our youth do? a solution can be to take these western concepts and "islamisize" them. a good example would be clothing. take the western pant/shirt and make them longer, and looser. as muslims we should look decent and healthily smart, not overly dressed to the extreme. and muslims we should not lose our identity in the process. 
Female:99.95%, Female, evlon challenges its customers to “get cheeky” with their new pinch me sheer gel blush. being the makeup junkie that i am, i rose to the challenge and decided to give this new product a try. i did hesitate for a brief minute since i’d never heard anything positive about blush gels, but ultimately i decided to jump on in. i’m glad that i did!
Female:100.00%, Female, the husband finished his breakfast and refused to take mom to the bank or walk lucky when asked. mum won't drive with me and would rather cancel her plans instead, which she did. as i was beginning to log out, what a girl wants was playing on tv and it was too tempting to let pass but i had to. i had things to get done. the husband went to sleep and refused to move, no matter how many times i called him. annoyed and needing a break, i sat down to watch the movie.
Female:100.00%, Male, not sure where to start on this one, it moved me and brought me to tears. this young girl, precious jones, it starts off with her a 16 year old girl. she has no education, and is very overweight. wannabe father molesting her, her mother is a worthless abusive figure in her life that resents her for the father molesting her, and her bearing children of his. precious is abused and discarded thru her life at home, brought me to tears the things her mother said to her. i can see why monique won the oscar, ( she played the mother) it had to been a hard role to act.
Female:100.00%, Male, i spent a lot of time last week cogitating about the topic for my next blog. the ideas that crossed my mind ranged from the mirthful experiences in my college (in continuation of my first blog) to the heavy ones like ‘hindutva’. i also thought of writing about my blissful life in school but later decided against it. as i sat down to write about anything which inaugurates my thought process, a much uncomplicated idea came to my mind about the most cherubic and audacious (arguably) person on this heavenly planet. yes, i am going to write few things about my angelic mother (though in a slap-stick way!!). well i am not going to discourse the love that is shared in the mother-child relationship (for that you can always listen to the famous song from taare zameen par). what i am going to talk about here are rules that every mother sets in her house to keep a check on people living under her domain (well in my case, this kingdom consists of me, my brother and dad too!!). if you are a girl and are reading this, chances are you would not agree. but read on and i am sure you would be convinced.
Female:66.16%, Female, it's our 20th episode and to help us celebrate, ugo's man about town, parker ward, dropped in to discuss the current holy tv trinity of idol, lost and the olympics. are simon and ellen really mortal enemies or is their "feud" just another lame publicity stunt? does survivor really suck? is hoarders the best thing since intervention? and when will claire quite yammering about her "bay-bay?" all this and more answered to the best our ability on this week's cast! let us know your thoughts on these matter in our facebook group and keep toob tied on constant rotation by subscribing to us on itunes! 
Male:69.88%, Male, then i went out a bought a new truck that had xm built in. at first i missed being able to see the name of the artist and the song at the same time, and i missed not being able to set it to tune to certain songs or artists that i liked to hear more than others...but i got over it! 
Male:99.99%, Male, lenovo has built a reputation for constructing quality laptop keyboards, as evidenced by those found in its thinkpad and ideapad lines. but a good keyboard has somehow eluded its 10-inch netbook line until now. in addition to getting new intel parts, the lenovo ideapad s10-3 ($370 direct) has received a full-size keyboard and the kind of typing experience that has garnered praise for netbooks like the editors' choice toshiba mini nb305-n410 ($400.00 direct, ) and the hp mini 5102 ($400 direct, ). unfortunately, while the toshiba nb305 and hp 5102, which have a roomy touchpad and soft mouse buttons to compliment the keyboards, the s10-3's one-piece touchpad does the opposite.
Male:100.00%, Male, recently, i was frustrated while trying to package a java keystore file from my maven project to a project archive (tar or zip) using assembly.xml. somehow, when i used the command: keytool -keystore cacerts -list on the certificate keystore inside the tar/zip archive, it would just say that the keystore is invalid. after some search, i found that there is a little setting in the pom.xml which instructs maven not to do any filtering tasks on the files you specify when you execute a maven command.
Female:99.95%, Female, and. my hair!? something really weird is happening to my hair! i can't seem to find a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't leave my hair grimy and gross. in the last couple of weeks every shampoo and conditioner i have used makes my hair feel like it has a terrible build up.
Female:99.54%, Female, i love this show! unfortunately, i didn't watch it when the it was on during it's regular season, because i didn't think it would be any good. i happened upon a rerun of it one day, and fell in love.it is one of the funniest shows on tv! my husband i tivo every episode and watch them back to back! i cannot understand why it was canceled!? it is so entertaining and funny. i love jason bateman!!! and portia de rossi is so beautiful!

Male:99.82%, Male,  1. no ice… if your ice maker has stopped making ice then you need to check these things. 1. the lever that controls the ice maker has been pushed up which turns it off. if you have a red lever, pull it down to the wire and if you just have a wire then just pull down the wire to start your ice maker up. 2. make sure the freezer temperature is below 10 degrees f if the freezer is too warm ice production will be poor because the ice maker will not cycle properly. 3. the ice maker fill tube may have ice formed in it, blocking it. use a hair dryer to melt the ice. watch out for the plastic parts, so that you do not melt the plastic. also check the water inlet valve and the shut off valve, to make sure it is not plugged with debris. the openings in those valves are very small. 4. check the gears in the ice makers to see if they are broken or stripped. also look to see if the ice rake is broken. all parts in the ice maker are replaceable individually, if you find broken parts replace them.
Female:96.72%, Female, my last three flights booked on jetblue were all cancelled. without notice. without warning. no phone call. no email. it has been extremely frustrating. while i know flight cancellations happen, i do expect to be notified so i don't get all the way to the airport before i find out!
Male:98.84%, Male, whenever i feel the urge to play the older games, i always whip out super mario bros.3 for the regular nintendo. it is always fun. these games are the originals. i love playing any super mario game no matter for what console.
Female:100.00%, Female, i use all of hylands products! i love the arnica and any time someone is hurt i give it to them. i also love the fact that it is safer than name brand products you see in the store. about four years ago my daughter fell and hit a sprinkler so hard that it snapped in half. my parents were going to give her tylenol and i said no!! the bruise was about four inches all the way around. i had my mom give her arnica tablets three times a day and then apply arnica cream to the bruise in the morning and then again at night. 
Male:99.97%, Female, obesity is a rising problem in western societies. in the uk, according to nhs statistics (published in feb 2009) for the year 2007, 24% of adults (ie those over 16) were classified as obese, an increase of 15% from 1993, and 37% of adults had a raised waist circumference (over 88cm for women and 102cm for men) compared to 23% in 1993. it is estimated that in america, at any given time, about two-thirds of the population (at a ratio of two women for every man) are on a diet (ref: centre for disease control and prevention), with only 5% successful at keeping off the weight lost.
Female:99.97%, Male, yesterday chief ican went out to visit mrs. westup. he wanted to see the miracle appliances for himself. amila was happy to see him and to be given the chance to show off the wonderful things that had come into her life. he had her retell him how she got up and found everything there . she hadn’t been awaken by any noise during the night. chief ican thought that was really weird since when they put the new hot water heater in the jail half the town could hear the racket the plumber made.

Male:99.96%, Male, i traded in my 2003 ultra classic (42,000 miles) in august on a new 2009 ultra classic. the dealership i bought from was making deals too good to refuse. they even beat a different dealers offer, on a 2008 model no less, by $3000 ! mine is the new for 2009 flame blue pearl color. it has turquoise pin-striping as well. so far, having ridden about 2,500 miles, and in 2 other states, i am loving it ! it rides smoother and firmer than the "03 did. i attribute this to the new,wider rear tire/wheel.
Female:99.98%, Female, ve done a lot of research when it comes to dog food. i am not a dog owner that buys my dog cheap food that has potential to cause a lot of allergies. california natural is one of the best, top of the line dog food you can buy. my dogs have the softest coats. i am a doberman owner and i do not cheap out on my 'babies'. that being said, a large bag is close to $45-50 in michigan. furthermore, i have to drive about 25 miles to get a bag because the local pet stores (petsmart, petco) do not sell this line. 
Male:98.77%, Male, it must have been torture for south park creators trey parker and matt stone, as all the tiger woods events unfolded while they were on hiatus.when you dangle raw meat above a cage of wolves (or tigers), they tend to get hungrier and a lot more rabid - and in trey and matt's case - a lot more creative.finally, we get to see what must have been brewing in their deeply disturbed minds all these months with the season fourteen premiere entitled "sexual healing."
Female:99.94%, Female,  my uncle for one will vouch for banning me from almaghrib, yes, this isn't the first time sammo has decided she has has has to go to an almaghrib class and tell him that it would be advisable to come another weekend, that is if him and the family decide to pay us a visit (which they probably will). i love my family and relatives and they have and always will be priority, but almaghrib is my life now and sometimes its hard to decide between the two loves of my life.
Female:100.00%, Female, wow, the us is gorgeous.....and big! i just got back from a five day trip to yellowstone national park and the grand tetons with my 13 year old nephew. what a fantastic trip! it is like bringing your 7th grade science class with you on tour.i generally knew what a geyser was, but, well not exactly. and the difference between a geyser and a hot spring or boiling mud pot? no, not at all. with land spontaneously spitting out steam and mud bubbles, you can see why a 13 year old boy had a fabulous time.
Female:63.09%, Female, my husband and i love watching "arrested development" on dvd. we need to buy the series already!! we have rented the entire 3 seasons from netflix too many times to count. what i really want to know is who made the decision to take this series off the air? i mean seriously, are they still employed at fox or what? i would love to hear your comments if you know the answer or even want to rant.
Male:98.46%, Male, sorry, schwim-fans, but ross gellar is off the market.as reported by us magazine, david schwimmer (43) will soon tie the knot with his girlfriend of three years, zoe buckman (24). and yes, your math is correct: daddy schwimmer took her to get her first legal drink.actually, that’s not entirely accurate, as the lucky couple (it’s the first marriage for both) met in england on the set of schwimmer’s successful comedy run fatboy run. and just to be clear, by “successful,” i mean, “only comedy that’s successfully made simon pegg not funny.” so that means buckman has possibly been drunk since she was eighteen, which may explain her taste in men.
Female:100.00%, Female, his straightener is okay, when i first got it i was so excited, it worked great but i was noticing that after awhile it didn't work as good. it's been 5 months now and when i put it on a lower temperature it automatically turns off, and the plate covering is all chipped off. so basically i am going to have to buy another straightener due to i can't use this one anymore or it will chip even more. if you are planning on buying this product, i highly recommend you take extra good care of it or it will definitely break soon enough. i am going give the sedu a shot! 
Female:100.00%, Female, although i should be doing 100 other things, i just want to write and say how happy i am and how blessed i feel. i think i have the greatest kids in the whole wide world. they are really great! they try so hard to be good. thobe had an assignment the other day to fill out a star that said,, "i am special because..." and thobe wrote, "i am special because i am good." i hung that next to my phone. whenever i see it i think, "he is good. all my boys are just so good." i love them so much. 
Female:100.00%, Female, cargo plantlove eyeshadow ($20, sephora) is proof that “green” beauty is not merely eco-chic. it’s eco-fabulous.even if i didn’t know that this eyeshadow was organic, i really wouldn’t care. plantlove eyeshadow is, for the most part, silky, deeply pigmented and highly blendable.my top pick out of the collection is dove, a sexy and utterly wearable shade of neutral deep blue gray that performs beautifully as both an understated liner by day and a dramatic, lid-to-crease, smoked-out eyeshadow by night.
Male:69.46%, Male, so happy with it, got it 5 days ago... and more than happy, wifi, watchin movies, the sound, everything more than cool! 
Female:99.99%, Female, eating 5 fruit and vegetables a day. fortunately, the shops are helping us to achieve that goal. but don’t think just 5 fruit and no vegetables is enough; a new study by rush university medical center in chicago has concluded that eating 2+ vegetable a day can help slow down mental decline due to ageing. those people who ate 2.8 servings of vegetables almost halved their rate of memory decline compared to people who ate less than 1 serving a day. according to the study, it is not too late to start, as older people who started the 2+ veg a day still showed significant delay in mental decline.
Male:100.00%, Male, i've always been a gadget fiend, having bought dozens of digital cameras, mp3 players, handheld gps devices, and cell phones .. now all in one. my favorite things * design - so clean, plus love the touch screen * google maps - more than a map, also shows you bus/train options and travel time * google voice search - much easier to say a few words than to type them * safari - full on web browser, fast when on wifi * mp3 player - love my 32gb and sync with itunes playlists * all the apps - games, productivity * and specific to 3gs - way faster than 2g, and compass makes some apps better, like google maps 
Male:99.96%, Male, it's really difficult to settle on any one aspect of this episode that i'm the most excited about. i was serious when i noted two weeks ago that chuck offers more plot progression and character development than any 5 episodes of lost, and "chuck vs. the tic-tac" offered that, and so much more.it takes guts to remove the fangs of any series' most bad-ass character, but all our base are belong to adam baldwin for handling the birth of, defection and (figurative) death of john casey with such believable dramatic weight. 
Male:91.37%, Male, in case you don't already know, last night i won "puckett's rising star" competition. this was a contest held at puckett's grocery in franklin among nashville songwriters judging on song quality and performance. the contest had three rounds; 8 seperate opening rounds, a semifinal round of sixteen, and a final round of four writers. (about 120 writers total)
Male:99.87%, Female, "i often compare backbreaker, weirdly, not to other football games, because we feel it's so different. the game that comes to mind for me is burnout. burnout's a driving game, but you don't need to be an expert driver to have fun with that. because even if you fail in burnout, you fail spectacularly and it looks cool and it feels good. even when you've just smashed your car up, it looks really cool.
Female:99.93%, Male, i was born in 1946 and lived outside of mitchell, south dakota by the james river i did a lot of hunting, fishing and trapping. there was a rock dam on the river where at one time stood a flour mill. i would spear carp and sell them to a nearby mink farm where they where used as mink food. i went to riverside grade school, a one-roomed country school house ….then i went to mitchell senior high. 
Female:94.65%, Female, last saturday we went to a so called gypsy fair, which was more market for weird stuff then actual fair. but the “house trucks” were interesting to look at. if you imagine an old gypsy wagon then transpose it onto an older style truck you kind of can imagine what they were like. but overall it was rather disappointing, as much is becoming here. like greg’s aspirations for work. for weeks he diligently prepped his resume, reviewed immigration information and made profiles on various job search websites. but often when he went back to those websites he couldn’t use his log in information and so emailed the websites for assistance. 
Female:98.29%, Male, try as i might i just cant seem to get you off my mind. you’re so much better than any other i could hope to find. no need to be kind i can see you’ve made up your mind. you’ve been nothing but an absentee to me, but i know i don’t want to be free from your grasp. slippery as it may be.
Female:96.91%, Male, my across the street neighbor has a two-year old chocolate lab, which turns out to have had serious knee problems in her back legs. (actually, they are called hocks, but the right word only gets in the way here.) 
Male:99.96%, Male, as much as i liked - but didn't necessarily love - avatar, i absolutely got that it was a big-screen, 3d, imax experience, meant to be enjoyed in an immense theater, filled with the latest in cinematic technology and surrounded by fans as emotionally connected to the material as yourself. it was the kind of movie that simply wouldn't be as engaging at home, no matter how high the definition in which you watched it...or how large your television...or how great your sound system... 
Female:100.00%, Female, his is the only food i have purchased for my bully since he was ten months old. it was highly recommended in my online bully groups; so thought i would try it. and i have never been disappointed for a minute! i have noticed how much easier it is for my dog to eat this than the puppy food he was on; as well as the fact that his flatulence is now virtually non-existant. i can't vouch for the flavor as my dog will eat anything; but i do believe in this product! i buy mine at petco; and a bag at a cost of approximately $35 will last me about a month; and every tenth bag is free! 
Male:86.30%, Male, rather than a straight adaptation of carroll’s stories, woolverton has chosen to stage her story 13 years after the events in the books, which essentially makes this film a sequel of sorts; its closest cousin in this arena is another disney-sanctioned reworking of classic children’s literature, walter murch’s return to oz (1985), an extremely dark and violent product of the reagan era that has virtually nothing to do with victor fleming’s candy-colored musical. as dorothy did in that film, alice returns to wonderland years later, only to find it enmeshed in conflict and alarm. both films reunite their young heroines with an array of weird and endearing characters, and interestingly both also feature queens who are obsessed with decapitation (in return to oz, the evil queen keeps a closet of assorted heads to “wear,” whereas in alice in wonderland helena bonham carter’s red queen just likes to cut them off). 
Male:96.70%, Male, the turning point of the game came in the fourth quarter when clint sessions picked off joe flacco and returned it for a touchdown. and if that wasn't enough, robert mathis stripped flacco on the next play and the colts recovered.
Female:100.00%, Female, i've made my very first mosaic picture, and it's all thanks to mary over at little red house and the tutorial that she made! i do also want to thank brenda over cozy little house for giving me that info! thank you both so much! seeing how much i loveeee pictures i know what i'm going to be doing alot of. please don't forget to stop in at mary's blog little red house, she's the hostess of mosaic monday and there you'll be able to view every ones beautiful mosaic pictures, maybe even enter yourself! so until the next time...bead happy! hugs and happy beading...
Female:90.52%, Female, my charts are becoming real pieces of art these days. my most recent work is the gumball chart, inspired by chase's deep desire for a gumball machine in the house. my kids don't chew gum at this point in their lives unless it's a special treat from gramma, but i'm liking the idea of having one in the house for the sole purpose of rewarding super excellent behavior. so, once all three of the gumball charts are filled, we'll head to the store to find a real life gumball machine of our own. 
Female:99.96%, Male, as i drift in and out, i can only hope that you are doing the same. somewhere else wherever you may lay i hope you dream of delightful days with you and i. dream of me as i dream of you, dream of me as only you can see. dream of me as i dream of me. dream, just let yourself go ahead and dream...your all i really care about. and there is no doubt that i'd wait forever and a day until your ready to be with me…
Female:99.99%, Female, i have been flying for over 50 years domesticly and internationally. during that time, i have flown a lot of different airlines.several years ago, i flew jet blue airways with my daughter and grand-daughter and we absolutely loved it.jet blue airways was clean and looked new. there was actual enough leg room so you didn't feel like you were sitting in the other passenger's lap.jet blue provided me with many choices of delicious snacks.
Male:99.96%, Male, have you ever craved an ever-evolving, dynamic music library within the confines of your portable music player? did you ever hear a song on the radio...and then wish you could record it on the spot...even if the song was almost finished? do you ever get bored with choices of your stale music collection on your ipod...and wish you had a better source for finding new music, that just isn't being played on the fm dial?
Male:83.47%, Male, guinness is another beer with a pseudo cult following.  there are people that love the stuff so much they buy hats and shirts to let you know they like guinness.  guinness represent something of a different take on beer than most people are use to. it is dark and looks different. i guess people respond to that sort of anti-yellow beer sort of thing. i remember in my younger light beer drinking days i pretty much thought guinness was a horrible joke. why would anyone drink something that dark and heavy?
Female:97.89%, Female, what is my end goal? to change something, somehow. or, at least, to understand better, mejor, and in a way that can contribute to some change being made. because if nothing gets done... so what? i don't want to have just gotten paid to write a big extra-curricular research paper that will do nothing for anybody. i write, this summer, to help myself next spring. i write, next spring, to help us understand. i write, now, for the joy of it, because i am in love with the process. because this is part of how i process, how i think, how i act. 
Female:99.86%, Female, i thought the snitching phase had died down, but apparently not. because recently i've been hearing it all over again. and to be honest, i get sick to my stomach when i hear people say that! why would someone want to save or protect a criminal who has harmed or killed someone!? why should a murderer or someone who will harm again be allowed to? i mean someone help me out here! lets say the victim was your best friend, mother or your child. would'nt you want someone to come forward?
Male:99.97%, Male, i have just finished reading no exit by william garvin, out now from harry godwin's arthur shilling press. garvin's poems are 'science fiction', but more than that they feel as though they're constellated from the debris or rather the 'glitter trails' of 'science fiction'. so the first poem begins 'strugatsky sequence. diary]' and there's a beautiful short poem called 'tarkovsky', in which the words are printed so close to the edge of the page it's tempting to believe in something missing, some clue that makes the poem less strange and haunting.
Female:100.00%, Male, where am i? middle of no where? where is coffee shop? oh... no gps… first day, we spent all the day in a 15 passenger van. second day, we only prepare things, such as we went to wal-mart for foods, pray and get some tools ready for the school. we brought 363 dollars food. thanks for the campus ministry taxes free sponsor. i was impressed how abbey novak got everything ready by her own, especially meals for all of us and for all the kids who are invited to come.
Female:100.00%, Female, some years ago before my mother had passed away she loved to bead and boy did she ever bead the most beautiful of pieces! i thought that today i would show you what she had made for me one st. patrick's day that i really treasure now.
Female:99.92%, Female, jaden and i usually have our date night on fridays, so we just had one a few hours ago. as usually, it was a hit. jaden got to pick the date night agenda and he picked books and two pokemon movies. he asked if we could read three books together and he wanted me to watch two pokemon movies with him. well, he fell asleep halfway through the first movie. i ended up taking all 65lbs of him upstairs to his bed, but it was still such a success! he had the biggest smile on his face as he was giving me the 411 on charizard and pikachu.

Female:85.81%, Male, i guess there's not too much to say. there never really is. i'm stuck in an odd "other" realm where i have no time to invest in things that would further my own personal happiness but i have all the time in the world to sit and wish i was doing something else. i guess i'm spoiled, at least a little. after looking at my last credit card bill, yikes, i picked up freelance writing to fill the cracks my paycheck doesn't want to cover and, for the most part, it's working well. 
Female:99.98%, Female, baby has officially graduated from embryo to fetus and has grown to about 1 inch in length. about the size of a medium green olive. his or her head is continuing to develop and take on more baby-like proportions. this week, tiny muscles are starting to form. this will allow her to move her arms and legs. it will still be awhile before i can feel it though!
Female:99.98%, Female, this morning, i prayed the "prayer of faith" and i heard the lord's gentle voice said , "let it be so." and it was so . all day, i felt jesus touching me and to me i had felt a big difference in me. i felt the holy spirit all over me and it was so amazing. i kept on thinking jesus all morning and into the evening. the definition of faith is in hebrews 11:1. what made thought of jesus was this song "i could only imagine"

Male:100.00%, Male, sony announced the release date today for modnation racers: may 25. if you're wondering whether that goes for the playstation 3 or playstation portable version, the answer is "both." as previously reported, the title is set to launch on both platforms, simultaneously, and with similar feature sets. the title is carrying the torch of little big planet's "play, create, share" model, with the ability to create and share custom tracks.the blog also outlined the pre-order incentives for the game, which vary according to retailer. each of the "modded," mighty-mugg-style racers hails from a well-known sony franchise (above). gamestop pre-orders will receive kratos and his "kart of chaos." 
Female:99.21%, Female, remember all those "annoying" things that women do? yeah, it occurs to me, as a woman who does precisely none of those things, that guys actually like that. but check it out, ladies: they're sneaky about it. they give it different names. 
Female:99.77%, Female, i always thought that having a dream is stupid… because people always say, instead of keep dreaming, why can't you be practical?? stop dreaming and come back to reality! this is life!! well, what's life without a dream, eh? now i know it's ok to have a dream, no matter how unreachable or ridiculous it is :) even though i know some dreams are hard to reach, i'll still try my best to chase that dreams of mine. sure, maybe i might not be able to reach that dream. but hey, when i look back in my life, at least there won't be any regrets! because i'm a dream-chaser instead of a dream-crusher.
Male:100.00%, Male, i have been toying over the idea of creating a separate blog for my technical wanderings for some time now. earlier, i had posted some technical posts on my main blog - www.abhishekontheweb.com, but, now, those seem out of place in a blog, which deals with more general stuff, like events, photography, articles (and whatever random thought comes in my mind). as, in the last few years, i have been working on various technologies, especially java based, i thought of writing about some of the technical ideas that i have been influenced by, technical issues i have been intrigued by, and the upcoming technologies that i am working on. and what better place than to have a new blog just for that. i would like to put in as much details as possible in my post, else this blog would defeat its purpose.
Female:99.98%, Female, ugh! i cannot believe how late i am with this! we had such a busy week last week! we had something going everyday! needless to say i didn't spend much time on the computer. (that might be a good thing!) since we have already finished our first week of our 2 week menu i am just going to post this week's menu. i will do better next time! i promise!
Male:94.94%, Female, when searching for a car seat, saftey was our number one priority. comfort was our second. the britax line of car seats delivers both. yes, they are more expensive than most of the car seats on the market, but once you experience them you will know why. they have the highest saftey rating in the industry, are built crazy strong, and are so comfy for your little ones. they are easy to clean as all of the covers come off and can be washed as well. 
Female:98.77%, Female, after upgrading from my old manual toothbrush to a sonicare electric toothbrush i would never even consider going back to using my old and outdated toothbrush again. i actually enjoy brushing my teeth now and it does not feel like a chore to do. my teeth feel a completely new level of clean since the switch and i know it is working better when i go to floss and there is barely any food left behind after brushing between my teeth unlike before, although yes flossing is still necessary. 
Male:79.93%, Male, ok fellas, hopefully all the stragglers have caught up and finished the first book by now! we have confirmed that we will have our first meeting saturday 12/12/09. do us all a favor and don't show up not knowing what the whole book is about because you didn't finish it. you might get voted off the island... our new book for december will be "holy lockdown", by jeremiah camara http://www.africanbookstore.net/proddetail.asp?prod=nf1401 http://www.amazon.com/holy-lockdown-church-limit-progress/dp/0974796700 the first link is from a black bookstore. support black business!! if that's not your thing their is also amazon. (don't worry, no one will know!)
Male:100.00%, Male, the most hyped game of the year. the rivalry of the decade. two of the all time best quarterbacks. home field advantage on the line. there was no way the game could live up to the hype surrounding it leading up to sunday night. they didn't hype it enough. in what will go down as an instant classic in this now historic rivalry, the indianapolis colts came from 17 down in the fourth quarter to steal a win from the new england patriots, 35-34.
Female:100.00%, Female, what have you been cooking and eating lately? it's been a while since i shared with you what i've been making so i thought it might be fun to share my latest adventure. first of all, i took a pasta making class a couple weeks ago at a place in waco called gourmet gallery. it's a cute little kitchen store and they also hold lots of classes where they teach you how to make things such as pasta, tamales, bread, mediterranean food, easter desserts...i mean it's quite the range of classes. it's amazing. the only negative thing is that it costs money to take these classes. (shocking, i know!) and often more money than i have.
Female:62.59%, Male, i'm a sucker for bowling alleys. maybe because bowling alone is one my favorite books. maybe because ed (wikipedia entry or imdb) is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. maybe because i love the independence square. or maybe because michelle, the manager is awesome. maybe because the great paula sorensen works there when she isn't at the main street coffee shop and/or singing great songs.
Female:72.06%, Male, 52 photowalks - i read about this project idea over here. the goal is to get out of the house once a week and walk around snapping photos. i'm hoping to do "themes" or "areas" for these walks and i have a list of ideas that i'm excited about - the difficulty will be finding time. my goal is to do almost all of these walks in the philadelphia area so at the end of the year, i'll have covered a decent amount of the city and surrounding area. i've posted my first one over here although i haven't decided on a format for these yet. more to come later.
Female:100.00%, Male, i never really did fit into the italian schedule of things here. i usually did my sightseeing during chuisora, italian siesta time. i headed to the beach typically when everyone else was leaving. i went out to dinner generally hours before everyone else. i visited cagliari when it was literally empty. what can i say? i had to plan much of my biking around the heat of the day. the sun was too strong for me to sit exposed on the beach in the afternoon. and, i'm not italian.
Male:58.95%, Male, the nfl hall of famer was one of the greatest defensive linesmen of our time when he played for the los angeles rams as part of the 'fearsome foursome,' and then embarked on a successful television career.
Male:99.97%, Male, here's one comic-book adaptation i would dearly like to see - wes anderson's take on spider-man. it is a tale of love and photography, of responsibility and revenge; a film so arch it's practically humpbacked. for all that, the amazing spider-man is not as much of a stretch as it first appears. downplay those distracting crime-fighting elements and peter parker could easily take his place amid the ensemble cast of the royal tenenbaums and the darjeeling limited. he is, in short, a very andersonian antihero.
Male:100.00%, Female, now that the zune hd is on sale, and the and the latest zune 4.0 software is live, we can definitively answer the big question: has microsoft finally caught up to apple in the realm of portable digital music players?after a full, hands-on, lab-tested zune hd review, we can safely say that the ipod touch is still the king of the hill when it comes to high-end touch-screen devices. even so, the zune hd is very impressive and goes a long way to redeem the zune name. besides the touch, it's easily the next-best mp3 player you can buy. if you want to live outside the itunes ecosystem, it should be at the top of your list.
Female:99.94%, Female, i have flown with thai air several times and each time it has been fabulous. i always choose to fly with them even if they are more expensive than other airlines. they have great food, and a lot of it....be prepared for a minimum of 5 to 6 meals on your trans-pacific flight. stewardess's uniforms are always colorful and very beautiful.
Female:100.00%, Female, so i've come to the dark side. well not really but i've bought my first dc comic. and anyone who knows me will tell you that i'm a marvel girl all the way. well i have gone and bought power girl. and i must say that i love it! it's really well written. the only thing i don't like is that they draw her with really big boobs. i mean really big boobs. but other then that, i really like the comic. it is on it's 10th issue this month and i would really suggest everyone to go out and read it. for once there's a good female comic. they give her attitude and don't make her this dumb blonde. she can defend herself and she has some spunk to her. she looks good but man she has some punch behind her. so i guess i'm kicked out of the marvel club house (i have borrowed that statement from the nerdy bird) but i'm ok with that. power girl is a good read. 
Female:74.62%, Female, paula begoun is the creator and innovative force behind paula's choice skin care and cosmetics. she is the author of 18 best-selling books including don't go to the cosmetics counter without me, blue eyeshadow should be illegal, the original beauty bible, and don't go shopping for hair-care products without me. paula’s books have sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide.
Female:79.03%, Male, i took my spare dab radio into work to listen to whilst i sort the stores out. and i had the misfortune to tune into planet rock. but, initially, i gave the station a chance to enlighten me for once. true to its' output, planet rock disappointed me immensely. 
Male:99.46%, Male, i can still remember hearing about terrorist attacks against westerners in saudi arabia while i was in boarding school and wondering if my parents and brother and sister were alright. both my parents seemed to be vulnerable at different times to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. it was always such a relief to hear their voice after one of the attacks that got close.
Male:99.90%, Female, in honor of fringe's april 1st return, it appears walter bishop is celebrating the day of fools by donning a ridiculous wig. or maybe it's just that walter's 'do is from 1985. yes, we will be having some bad 80's hair flashbacks in the upcoming mythology heavy episode "peter," as walter devles into his son's "otherworldly origins" with olivia. we'll also finally meet peter's mother (played by irish actress orla brady). for those fringe fans jonesing for a mythos fix, the spring return sounds like a first class ticket on a walter bishop acid trip. read on for more head-spinning spoilers.
Male:100.00%, Male, wii sports resort is the follow-up game to wii sports - the original game that came with the wii console. the main differnece besides there are new games / activities is the fact that it incorporates the wii motion plus adapter. the adapter connects onto the bottom of the wii mote where the nunchuk would plug into. the new adapter allows for greater sensitivity of the wii mote, allowing the sensor bar and wii to pick up more of the actual movoements of the person playing the game.
Male:99.93%, Male, so, one weekend we were sitting on top of the jungle gym when roger reached into his backpack and unveiled his most recent acquisition, the price tagger gun from his parents’ store. “this is the coolest thing in the world. i can stick a price on anything now,” he said, fiddling with the dial for a bit, then promptly tagging the jungle gym at 88 cents per can. “see? now if anyone wants to buy this jungle gym, they have to pay us 88 cents!”
Male:99.86%, Male, that is showing tremendous relative strength, as well as there is a buy signal with our two other indicators. we use stochastic and on balance volume to confirm a move, and they both show buy signals. place a stop loss order under $16.00 and our target for this company is $25.00
Male:99.92%, Male, i really think the show would be better if they kept the boys and girls separate until the top two. a two-hour show at this point is impossible to sit through, even with the help of tivo. tonight's comments from the judges were pretty good for the most part. my comments, in order of appearance:michael lynch is by far the best of the guys and will make it to the top few (although dialidol.com disagrees).didi was better than expected again. she's not my choice by a long shot, but is safe for at least another 3 weeks.casey was better this week, but i'm not sure how long he will last. his song choice was not right for him
Female:100.00%, Female, in a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. stir in the turkey and flour. add the milk, and heat through. stir the turkey mixture into the vegetable mixture, and cook until thickened. cool slightly, then pour mixture into the unbaked pie shell. roll out the top crust, and place on top of filling. flute edges, and make 4 slits in the top crust to let out steam. 
Female:100.00%, Female, over the past few years it seems like cosmetic companies come out with some new life-altering mascara every other week. i'm never the girl who's quick to run out and buy a new tube of mascara because i've found that plenty of them don't work at all or that they just don't give me the look i'm going for. even though i was blessed with a head full of thick hair, my eye lashes, it seems weren't so lucky. they are thin and they're barely noticeable without mascara. they also have a natural curl which is good because i don't have to use an eye lash curler, but it's also bad since the curl causes my eye lashes to look short and stumpy.the maybelline define a lash mascara has been on the market for a year or so and it's gotten great reviews in magazines and adriana lima endorses it. 
Female:99.97%, Male, ok here we go. i am off the pip next friday. that is if i am still there. i found out in my 1:1 today that in addition to no more sick time, i have 7 hours personal time and 4 hours of vacation time. i am screwed!!! per my manager i wrote to hr to see what happens should i get sick. i think i already know corporate americas answer but i will let them humor me. there has to be a law against this but il being an at will state. so now i am not sure how much longer i will be working there. sad part i actually liked this job. starting to look now to leave on my own terms. insurance is going to be fun as usual but we shall see and we will survive.
Female:100.00%, Female, i am swooning over this dresses on the newly discovered eve gravel shop. the shop is canadian based and sells the most wonderful items. the dresses are all i ever wanted for spring (and all year long). and the model photos are gorgeous! oh pretty dresses, how i pine for you! 
Female:60.90%, Male, did not win on friday. in fact, only got one digit right. and another work week starts and it still counts what i do at work. as you can see i didn't "open the box" by playing those numbers. i guess i'm lucky! let's see if 2010 brings some surprises. not much news. did not get struck by lightning (yay), did not win the lottery (yay, not). anyway...we'll try again 
Female:100.00%, Female, ever wonder how celebrities get such beautiful, glowing healthy skin? if they're not lucky enough to be born with it, like this hollywood mother-daughter duo, they must have some tricks up their sleeves … right? yup. and though we don't claim to be geniuses or anything, from what we've seen on the red carpet (and learned from the many skin care experts, celebrity makeup artists and top dermatologists we've chatted with), we know that healthy-looking skin starts before you ever pick up your foundation brush. before you ever try to cover up those dark circles and red or brown spots (aka sun damage and acne). you must first nip imperfect skin in the bud by first addressing something else: your uneven skin tone.
Male:100.00%, Male, most photographers would balk at spending $2k for a fixed-lens digital camera, but leica has a large following, and the leica x1 ($1,995 list) will find a happy home with many of the company's devotees. like the leica m8 ($5,995 list), the x1 features an aps-c image sensor—the same size sensor found in much larger digital slr cameras, such as the editors' choice canon eos rebel t1i ($899.99, )—capable of producing d-slr-quality images. though leica priced the x1 at a fraction of the m8, image quality is still top notch. but when you compare it to cameras from other manufacturers, such as the lumix dmc-gf1 ($899.99, ) from panasonic, the x1 becomes much less attractive. though you won't find a camera as small as the x1 with comparable image quality, you can spend far less on larger cameras that offer more features, comparable image quality, faster autofocus, no shutter lag, interchangeable lenses, higher resolution lcds and hd video capture. 
Female:90.62%, Male, our local public high school is pretty good. nice facilities, gang & drug problems that are either non-existent or invisible, and motivated teachers. my wife and i stay pretty involved in our kids educations. one of the things we do, when able and required, is to go over their tests with them to see where things went astray.
Female:100.00%, Female, maybe it's because we've had a few warm days after an extremely hard winter, but i just feel so blessed and so happy. i know that god lives and that he loves me and my family. i'm so grateful that he blessed me with michael and my boys and also incredible parents, siblings, in-laws and friends. i love this beautiful earth and am so grateful that i know where all these blessings originate. i truly am grateful for all god does for me.
Male:100.00%, Male, if arsenal get inter in the next round expect 180 minutes of squeaky bum time with little action. my flat mate (the united fan) reckons arsenal'll get bordeaux or cska moscow. obviously i won't complain if we do but one thing's for sure: if chelsea got through tonight they'd definitely have gotten one of those 2 in the quarters so let's all be grateful for that and keep our fingers crossed for a united-barca match up. if we can avoid them enroute we can make the final. since bendtner's late winner on saturday against hull the stat men have said that arsenal officially score the most late goals (after 75 mins) in the premier league. i think any arsenal fan would probably know that to be true too. i was stood watching the hull game in the pub and my girlfriend came in after work with about 10 minutes to go and asked if i'd be grumpy if we drew. we both knew the real answer but i said i wouldn't be. i was surrounded by grumpy gooners. that was until bendtner scored and the place went absolutely ballistic and it felt fantastic. dan, my other flatmate (the one without a club), was watching with us and as i looked around for him i noticed, what at first glance, appeared to be scuffle. in actual fact dan had been mobbed in his celebrations by two arsenal fans in their fifties. it was such a relief and the grin on dan's face as we left the pub was amazing. he said he was thinking about supporting arsenal and i told him that if he wanted to he was more than welcome but that disappointment is as much a necessity of being a gooner as faith in arsene wenger is. in truth i was dead chuffed. 
Male:99.99%, Female, ....i'm going on a rant for a few minutes....here's my issue.... i understand that there are a lot of dead beats out there who don't pay child support after their divorce. but when someone is actually trying.........and not just saying that they are.......then should they really get a lot of crap of not being able to pay it? they may be making a truck payment......just barely by the hair of their chinny chin chin.......but if they don't make the truck payment they can't work, and if they can't work there's no possible way of them ever getting caught up on child support. it's not like they're taking the meager amount of money they are getting an blowing it on anything meaningless. they're actually trying to pay bills and do the right thing. besides being 400 behind isn't nearly as bad as being 1300 or more behind....like other people. the way i see it.....yes, child support is supposed to be paid...of course no one is arguing that....and there is no excuse for those who aren't even putting out the slightest bit of effort...but if someone is having a hard time...like the loss of a job and not getting anything in between but a few crap opportunities that wind up going nowhere....then shouldn't they be cut just a little slack? it's not like they lost their job because they stayed out all night drinking and couldn't wake up for work.....or decided to go to a bar instead of earning money.....maybe the company they worked for shit on them and they've had a hard time finding anything since. i think people should stop being so vindictive and appreciate the fact that their child actually has someone who is really trying to help support them and is busting their ass to try and make sure they will be able to catch up as soon as possible. and if people are going to throw "i need to buy groceries for your kid," or "i can't pay bills because you don't pay me," please be sure and leave out the part about trying to make it a point to go the movies, or out to eat, or any other outing at least once a week. if you're blowing your money doing those things, you can't be hurting that bad. you most certainly shouldn't threaten the other parent with loss of visitation to their child! yes the judge may have given you custody......but they're still the parent as well. you're not only hurting them but you will tear your child apart by using them as a weapon against the other parent!! the only reason that sort of threat should come about is if the child is not being taken care of or is in some sort of dangerous situation while under the supervision of the other parent......and never at any other time. i really hate hearing people do these things to other people. and for no other reason besides the fact they think it's a way to keep them under their thumb. some people think they have to have control of everything..........they need to grow up and realize that nobody ever has full control of anything. once they do that, they may be capable of being half way decent people.
Female:100.00%, Female, ok so maybe my once a week isn't turning out the way i had hoped....but it's not like i haven't thought about blogging! i have. in fact! i kept a pink post it note going on what i needed to blog about. it's full. so this will probably be pretty long. first on the list: i don't have enough guy friends. i don't necessarily have a lot of friends. (real friends anyway). but i definitely think i need more male friends. less drama. more laughs. and they generally don't get upset when you haven't hung out "in forever". second: i got netflix!! i loooooove it!! seeing a bunch of movies i've wanted to see but haven't. and it's cheaper. plus i can watch stuff online (too bad i don't have internet....). which brings me to point 3. dexter. best tv show ever!!! omg. it's disturbing and intriguing all at the same time. brilliant. i'm obsessed. finished season 1 and am on episode 6 of season 2. i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful dramas. but if you don't like the f word...maybe steer clear. it's shown on showtime and not cable so....but it's great!! fourth: have you ever felt like telling someone to suck it??? cause i have. a lot lately. i truly want to look at someone i can't stand and forcefully say "suck it." maybe throw in a bitch at the end too if i'm feeling really vengeful. i'm sick of the hypocrisy and dumb assed-ness. (<-totally made up that awesome word just now). but in all seriousness....i want a lot of people to pull their heads out their asses. fifth: i live next door to danville. it's a place for old people. it helps them find affordable housing and care and what not. but i think a lot of old/homeless people live in the building as well. anyway....either someone is about to croak, or they did b/c for the past week the fire dept has been there every night. i stand on the balcony and watch them. which brings me to point 6. wouldn't it be great if a firefighter looked up and saw someone watching them and decided to introduce them self and they fell in love and what not??? not saying me of course. it was just a crazy thought i had. then my next thought was, what a great novel! someone should get on writing that. stat.
Female:100.00%, Female, my heart broke once i made a decision. i knew i could second guess my decision forever, so i promised myself not to dwell on it. we bought pikachu and brought her home. just like with the stuffed dogs, i wish i could have brought all the guinea pigs home and spoiled them like i am and will do to pikachu. it's only been two days since we brought her home, and i already can't imagine what it would have been like if i'd chosen the other guinea pig. guinea pigs are more like cats than dogs, in the sense that you have to earn their love. they're also prey animals so they're skittish and wary of humans. but pikachu is adjusting to her new life. she wouldn't eat the first day when we were in the room, but overnight she ate a little. now she's drinking water and eating lettuce and squeaking happily when we pet her behind her ears. when i was researching guinea pigs online, everyone who owned them and talked about them on forums and websites were really.. i don't know how to put it, but attached i guess? you can tell they think of them like family. just like people think of dogs like family, but maybe a little more obsessed. some people give their guinea pigs entire rooms instead of cages. but now i can see where they're coming from because i do love pikachu like she's family already. i doubt i'd ever have a room for guinea pigs, but i'm totally creepy guinea pig lady over pikachu ;) posted by caitlyndelaney at 12:34 am 0 comments tuesday, july 28, 2009 i'm going to get a guinea pig. one night, i randomly looked into getting some dwarf hamsters because i remember going to pet co. last year and thinking they were cute. i just want a small pet because i can't have a dog and i miss having a pet. the more research i did about dwarf hamsters, though, the less appealing they became. they're appartently not very tame and have only been domesticated for about a decade. they also are cannibalistic toward their young. however, i never wanted or looked into a guinea pig because i thought they were too big but i had heard great things about them. then i went to visit mike's sister nicki and she has one named yoshime. i'd never really paid much attention to her before, but i really fell in love with her. nicki let her out and let her run around and she was adorable. so then i started researching and mike even said he'd be interested in getting one now. i got really excited like a little kid and i got my hopes up. then we started talking about how our apartment building wouldn't allow pets. we thought about hiding it from them, but the landlords and maintenance burst into our apartments all the time unannounced so it would basically be impossible. i lost all hope, but decided to call anyway and check, even though our lease says "no pets at all. any pets found will result in an immediate fine of $1,500 and the pet must be removed." i called our apartment the next day, completely prepared. i had my confident voice and i had all my rebuttals ready. once they said no, i was going to tell them that i could certainly understand, but that i was willing to pay a pet deposit and that i would let them check up on the guinea pig at any time. however, i never had to use any of those rebuttals. the lady answered the phone and i asked if guinea pigs were allowed. she asked, "will it be in a cage?" and i said, "of course." and then she said it would be allowed. so then i decided that i'm definitely going to get a guinea pig. i'm going to wait until we move into our new apartment on the 21st. hopefully this isn't just a phase for me and a guinea pig will be a wonderful and friendly addition to the new apartment.
Female:99.61%, Male, in the spirit of newborns arrivals life has been a little less planned and a little more hectic. one might say we have currently it all under control, but those changes day-to-day or night-to-night. however, on the average we all are currently above water. alex has been doing well though; gaining weight, growing, eating, and sleeping. nathan is a sponge. he is learning everything and anything. the explosion of words, sentences and thoughts has really begun in full force. his imagination really has kicked in and he trains, planes, and cars have places to go. as a parent, the little things are really the highlights: a middle of the night kiss on the forehead from nathan while snuggling him back to sleep, a toothless grin from alex while singing to him, measuring tape races with nathan on the kitchen floor, alex sleeping on your chest. 
Female:100.00%, Female, today has gone well. i decided i can't just cold turkey quit smoking, so i've cut down a lot. i use to smoke a pack a day, but today i only smoked 3. so i'm hoping cutting down slowly will help me quit. i've had the taste of alcohol in the back of my throat all day but i've been fighting the urge to drink. it also helps that i moved into my mom and her boyfriend's house yesterday. they don't keep alcohol in the house. so that is helping a lot with the situation. i also moved to a new town which will be very helpful with my change. it will allow me to concentrate on it alot more. also i can make new friends that support my decisions. apparently there is a really good church here with a good youth group so i'll have to check that out soon. i'm hopefully going to be finding a job soon and getting my own car. this will help a lot with finding new friends.
Female:100.00%, Female, the 4 stages of converse shoes i've been through a lot with my onverse shoes. i've warn them throught my liffe so i know what it is like and i know the features of when you get new ones. i recently got new ones and i just want to tell you the 4 stages from when you first buy the shoes and when you just cant where them anymore. haha 1. this is the first stage of your new converse shoes. when you first try them one they are like totally cool and new but they havent really fit in with the size of your feet. they can feel hard and very new. 2. the second stage is when the converse fit in with your feet. but they just start to squeak. i was walking bye in the hallways of my school one day and it startd to squeak, and i noticed that all my converse shoes have done that. i didnt like it. its kinda embarrassing. 3. this is probab;y my favorite stage. the squeak just gos away and it fits within my foot. 4.the last stage. i'ts wearing out and the the word all star has just disappeared. time to get new ones. those were all the stages. but theres one thing about converse shoes that i hate. every time i put them on i have to stick my finger in the shoe to get my foot in and my finger is like rubbing against the shoes and it hurts like really bad. well not that bad. hehe thanks 4 reading this.
Female:100.00%, Female, so today, was long. i woke up early and finished an essay went to class not too lively of a day. but as i was walking home i heard a strange noise and as i walked closer to this man i noticed he was playing bagpipes. it was pretty interesting, i can say i have ever really seen someone play bagpipes in person before. now back to homework.so i have started classes again and to my amazement the three of my five classes all require course work to be done and turned in online. i am ok with this but the think that really irritates me is that each class uses a different website. one has motif one turnitin one d2l whatever that is. (desire to learn). and it doesn't stop there i need an iclicker. what the f*%k is an iclicker. incase you were wondering like i was an iclicker is a device used to participate in class. what happen to the good old-fashioned hand-raising, or class discussion. well thats it for now. i have to go register on my class websites. 
Female:100.00%, Male, i enjoy occasionally going lingerie shopping with my lady, initially out of curiosity about why the heck they cost so much more than men's undergarments, but i soon developed a keen interest in finding the right lingerie for my wife, as a way to spice up my sex life. finding the right lingerie can be tricky; one person's cosmetic lift may be another person's dysfigurement. it is therefore helpful that a married man should occasionally take time out to go shopping for lingerie with wife, for her comfort, his libido (and money), their bond. the first step is to determine what shape her body is. is she a pear, a ruler or an apple? a pear is a figure that is curvy. it's larger in the hips than in the tummy and has a smaller top than bottom. "pears" generally have large thighs and rears as well. a ruler is a figure that is fairly balanced with little curve. most "rulers" are very slim women. an apple figure is one that is much larger in the chest than in the hips and thighs. a woman who is apple shaped usually has a bit thicker middle but slim, toned legs. so figure out which figure she has first in order to determine which lingerie style will flatter her body the most. once you've determined her shape, the next step is to explore the different styles of lingerie that work with it. you should have a good idea of what styles of lingerie you (you and your other half) are looking for before you go shopping with her. also be sure to shop at a nice lingerie boutique for the greatest selection and quality. 
Female:92.71%, Male, and then they’d hang up on me all frustrated. like i was the idiot. like i’m running around town scratching the last digit off the phone number on the printed materials of hotels through the phoenix metropolitan area. some nerve i had, not taking their reservation over the phone for the hotel they didn’t call that i don’t work at. it started happening so frequently that i thought about actually just taking the reservations and letting them fend for themselves. hey, it’s not my fault they screwed up. but by the time i came to that resolution they stopped calling. i also used to get calls for somebody whose nickname was “golden boy.” this would not have been nearly as confusing had his real first name not been rich. hello? what’s up golden boy? what? is this golden boy? i don’t think so? is this rich? yes. rich gulden? oh. no. my dad’s cell phone number used to be 1 off from the towel department at bed bath and beyond. people called him on more than one occasion to get a conversation that went like this. 
Female:100.00%, Female, everyone forgets that icarus also flew. it's the same when love comes to an end, or the marriage fails and people say they knew it was a mistake, that everybody said it would never work. that she was old enough to know better. but anything worth doing is worth doing badly. like being there by that summer ocean on the other side of the island while love was fading out of her, the stars burning so extravagantly those nights that anyone could tell you they would never last. every morning she was asleep in my bed like a visitation, the gentleness in her like antelope standing in the dawn mist. each afternoon i watched her coming back through the hot stony field after swimming, the sea light behind her and the huge sky on the other side of that. listened to her while we ate lunch. how can they say the marriage failed? like the people who came back from provence (when it was provence) and said it was pretty but the food was greasy. i believe icarus was not failing as he fell, but just coming to the end of his triumph. 
Male:96.00%, Male, all of us have probably gone to school, or work with someone who is gay. we probably all got along well and probably still do. no harm came to us or anyone else around them due to their sexual preferences. we are fellow humans after all. the dislike that many exhibit towards them only starts once they make their sexual preferences public and for no good reason other than the fact that society, with its prejudices and ignorance teaches you to despise people inclined towards homosexuality
Female:95.90%, Male, 4:04 am, los angeles. i was just shaken awake by what i thought was someone grabbing the bottom of my bed and shaking it up and down. i went down the hall to the reception desk at the comfort inn in monterey park and i looked at the night clerk who is usually asleep and said, did something just happen? yes, he replied. that was an earthquake. i went back to my room and called braff zackton who was already at work in chicago. braff ran his earthquake search that he does every 30 minutes and informed me that i just rode a 4.4 in the greater los angeles area at 4:04am. it seems no one else is alarmed but me! that is completely whack and a first for me. 
Female:99.99%, Male, the optimistic meaning of life is what we all search for. isn't it? always the beauty of something so complicated, is put into such simple words, soul, love, life, understanding, acceptance. everything is so much more, you cannot express it in such simple words. everyday people die, and no one really recognizes, everyday people form and no one really recognizes it, and why? because were to busy searching for happiness, were all working, to get somewhere, where we think success is. people strive off of happiness, or the idea of it. its so hard to find, and often times people think they need to be rich and be very successful to be happy. that is completely irrelevant, happiness is inside of you, within you. when you are completely accepting of yourself, its when you can be happy by yourself, no help from others, to know that if everyone you know left you, you could still be happy at least a little, by yourself. i'm becoming happy again. katie day has helped me become happy again & i want to thank her for that. i just hope it last! i have learned that the people in your life the just wakes up one day and just leaves you behind and act like you dont mean anything to them and it really does make you feel so down in the dumbs you dont want to do anything! eat, can't sleep or even get to the point where you dont even dream good, thats when you just get up and learn to face the fact that they never have two shits about you. don't do what i have been doing, dont not eat, sleep, or even get to the point when you dont even want to do what you really enjoy. i ask you please! dont do this! just live you life like im learning to do again.
Female:99.77%, Male, so this is it for another year - december 31st 2009. i don't want to spend for ever ranting on about how my year went....just a brief look back on some of the highs and lows. 2008 was a rough year. 2009 wasn't a whole lot better....but, it was better. i encountered similar problems in 2009 as i did in 2008, but felt that i dealt with them better. kept some of the demons at bay. this is partly due to the medication i had been on, effexor xr (antidepressant). after being depressed on and off since high school, i finally gave in and tried it. it helped a lot. i hope the black dog never returns but one must always remain cautious. sadly, 2009 was a year of confrontation. i don't consider myself to be a confrontational person but 2009 unfortunately had several war moments. confrontation with hannah, former student, confrontation with elsa, my ex girlfriend and confrontation with maree, my ex friend. i had made attempts to resolve these issues with scattered and limited success. no point going into them now, let god be the judge. 
Male:98.56%, Male, so, over the thanksgiving holiday, when number one son was home from jhu for the break -- and after we dragged him (and number two son) to the mall -- and got number one a haircut (actually a trim) -- we wandered the mall as post-20th century consumer zombies are programmed to do. hell, somebody has got to keep the economy going. compulsively, i used the opportunity to inquire about my sons' ideas for christmas and birthday presents. number one son is transitioning into real manhood and after mentioning guitar legend (a campus rage), asked for a folding chair for his room, new pillows (as the university linens package ones suck), and a vacuum cleaner. number two mentioned various wii videogames that come out in february (sigh). my number one wife tried to get some group enthusiasm for zipping off to the movie theatre to see beowulf -- but despite the attraction of angelina jolie's frontal nudity (albeit "animated") -- we decided against what seemed to be an old english pre-quel to texas chainsaw massacre (well, not in texas and without chainsaws). so, upon passing by the saturday night matinee store, we wandered in to seek out some dvds to buy and watch at home. this is exactly the behavior that consumer market researchers adore -- "the impulse buy." number one son found "enemy at the gates" -- a film about the confrontation of a german and russian sniper during the battle of stalingrad in 1942. 
Female:100.00%, Male, after a couple weeks on the job i had become like my 60-68 year old parents, waking up at 5:45 am and going to bed before 9 pm. my social life had been condensed to a quick after work joint with a buddy followed quickly by bed time. this is how i know that life isn't too short. when your doing stuff like this, you often think it couldn't be any longer. one weekend i had decided that it was time for max to play. i had been working my butt of and i wanted to party. so, i left work early one friday in order to catch a good nap before the evening in order to wrangle the necessary energy for later that night. when i got home everything seemed normal and i was able to quickly fall asleep on the sofa in front of the tv. i was awoken later that evening by my dad. he asked me if i wanted to go for dinner with him because my mom wasn't feeling up to it due to some nausea and she had suggested we just go alone. by the time i had showered and gotten ready my mom's condition had taken a severe turn for the worse. she was lying in bed sweating profusely and complaining of pain in her stomach and back. ten minutes later she was having trouble breathing and was very weak. needless to say, we canceled our dinner and took her to the hospital. by the time we got to emergency with her she was mumbling, sweating, and could not walk, let alone later hold herself upright on a chair. i had to carry her through the emergency doors, too weak to even hold her arms by her side, allowing them to hang down toward the floor.

Female:73.99%, Male, i was watching a show on plane crashes. they were saying it's not one event that causes a crash but a series of events that leads to the crater. damn that sounds like my life! yah there's a lot of things we can do to hedge our peace of mind but what's the bottom line? our happiness or peace of mind because they're not the same. yah i could have got an mba bought a tire store in some corner of the world and lived out my life golfing raising five kids with the wife and making a difference in kawanis. if this is you god bless you. i've lived my life listening to that subtle whisper in me "keep asking more of yourself keep growing!" my art is humor my canvas my life. there isn't a single time i haven't been on stage that i haven't learnt something. i have chosen a life of pressure: corporate comic, comedy clubs, teacher, key note speaker but there are things i can do to guarantee results: keep finding ways to reinvent myself, keep looking at my goals and make sure my habits grow with them, keep re discovering ways to grow in my industry. i thought about the events that lead to a wreck. i can use this same criteria to examine my personal program. when i first began stand up my inner thought was panic. all my results came from that. panic was what i sent out and what i got back. my thought now is " let's explore follow me." my results are discovery and growth. if single events lead to result make sure your core thought is attracting the results you want. our core thought determine whether we fly or crash achieve our destination or stay stuck.
Female:80.30%, Female, and when i speak german, i have to express myself in exactly the same way. i can't convey the dark subtleties of my inner-being to the person in front of me. i ask. i get. simple as. so naturally, my personality and view of the world, how others percieve me and how i percieve myself, changes automatically. when i visit a restaurant and my meal isn't quite right, i have to tell the staff, as clear as day, what's wrong with it. straight off. if i were in england, given the nature of our language, i would be ridiculously apologetic for any inconvenience i may have caused them. if i said roughly the same thing in german, the waiter would look at me quizzically and ask what i'd done to it. in english i "remember"; in german i "remind myself". in english, i am the height of politeness. in german, i am constantly apologising for things i haven't done - and therefore just a bit weird. and in french? i am a german - over-rolling my "r"s and sticking verbs at the end of sentences. the languages i speak: as much as i may try to contort the words into something understandable to a native, you can guarantee that the words are contorting me twice as much. foreign languages - the best and quickest way to contract multiple personality disorder, what say you? 
Female:100.00%, Female, it has been more than one year from when i wrote my last blog. i require a lot of motivation to do this and of course a good reason as well. today i've got both to do this again. it's my 23th birthday, which is so specially to be cherished for the rest of my life. i had it in gottingen. although far away from family, i've got all the friends celebrated with me at the same time. messages from friends all over the world--- swiss, america, belgium, and france and for certain home. what's so surprising is the email from michiru who is a friend of mine in japan. despite the fact that she's been very busy with becoming a mother, she still remembers to send her best wishes just in time!! 
Male:100.00%, Male, politics on tuesday? easy: repubs are the danger at this point, who on the right is still kidding themselves: republicans are not for actual medical reformation. they never have been. they want to keep their corporate medical sponsors (granted, it's been hard for the dems with their corp med sponsors too). but the 'pubs haven't put effort into anything except not putting effort into the reform americans are desperately in need of. wait, that's not true. repubs are putting a great deal of effort into scaring the hell out of the ignorant american populace that the (obama v. 2.1) usa is going to take over their health care. and kill us all! it's true. ask beck or limbaugh or any of those other conservative ass-clowns who claim an allegiance to a more pure form of american government than the republicans. and everything obama does is bad and wrong and is deliberately so. obama hates america! so the democrats have to go and the republicans who don't get the am radio stamp of whateverthefuck (most of them) all need to go. and by fostering that level of ignorant voting rampage, and ignorant tea party education, you foster a frenzy-dom of stupidity, a madness of idiocy, all of them suckling on the teat of talk radio like a crack baby on its amphetamine-laced lactation. right wing radio: you're right. america is in danger. america is in danger from you. you are fostering not an educated populace, but an ignorant one. you are fostering your dream of an oligarchy ruled by madness that fits your version of reality. you are the danger. and as disconcerting as it is, i say: bring it on. usher palin into 2012. kill reform without solutions. we'll be waiting. with facts. and you will lose. 
Female:100.00%, Male, windy here this afternoon; gusts up around thirty-five mph. sitting here a bit back staring out my window, sipping a taste of wild turkey when i saw a cloud of newspapers sailing by. i ain't talking here about a few, but a goddam blizzard of them. i had a flashback to a year or so ago when i looked out there and saw a few thousand plastic grocery store bags flying around, most of which got hung up in my pine trees. remnants of some of them bags are still hanging around. carrying my glass of wild turkey, i strolled down to the road to see what i could see. what i saw was a vortex of newspaper raising from ms. graham's backyard and heading my way. i also saw ms. graham running around in the road trying to snatch her runaway newspapers out of the air. she wasn't having much luck. i like ms. graham, seventy-two year old retired school teacher, and subscriber to about nine newspapers, which, after reading, she piles in a stack on her back patio for a year or two. i walked on down to her. she was sort of shook up that her stash of newsprint was blowing off in a n/e direction and getting hung up on mailboxes, power lines, trees and such. i suggested to her it was not that big a deal; that newspaper would rot right into the ground pretty soon. "besides," i told her, "if i run out of toilet paper any time soon, i'll just go out and pluck some off my trees." you might think a seventy-two year retired school teacher wouldn't find that funny. you'd be wrong. 
Female:99.57%, Female, ....nothing much to write about today. nothing has pissed me off, nothing making me feel like turning cartwheels. although, if i turned a cartwheel right now, it would probably end up in a trip to the emergency room and that would piss me off. i just felt like typing so random stuff floating around in my head is ending up here. is that how you spell babbling? for some reason it doesn't look correct, but spell check says it is right. hmmm? oh well. why is it the games dare likes the most are the ones with the most annoying sounds? why is he soooo good at them? i kinda miss the simple games i used to play. especially the one where you shoot at the gopher stealing carrots out of your garden. if you hit him he would say "ugh, i'm hit. going down." if you only came close he would jump up and down saying "what was that for you idiot?" and then flip you off. i missed on purpose often. drove my mom insane. 
Male:100.00%, Male, you hear many vhristians claiming that their god is the absence of evil. they usually start their conversation with things like "dark is the absence of light" and "heat is the absence of cold". there is even the hoax letter that has been going around for years now about the student who supposedly one up's his mean evil atheist professor, using the very things said above. in some versions it is said that einstein did it, either way not only is it a fake and one of the worst christian arguments, it also provides one of the best counter arguments against such a god. i go over this in the form of a reductio ad absurdum in a previous blog, "a different look at the problem of evil", but lets form it into a direct argument against the god presented above. 1) god is pure good, the absence of evil. (matthew 19:17). 2) if god is the absence of evil, then evil exists only where god is not. 3) god is omnipresent, he is everywhere.(psalm 139:8, jeremiah 23:23,24) 4) evil exists. 5) therefore god does not exist so, either: 1. god does not exist or 2. god is not the absence of evil or 3. god is not omnipresent your thoughts? please be respectful in your debate. 
Female:82.80%, Male, i always joked around whenever i heard roy orbison sing his "you got it" song that he would have to spend a lot of money. he says that anything his girl wants, needs, or anything, he would give it to her. i knew that he was just speaking metaphorically, but it was still a little humorous to think that she could sit there and go: "okay...i want a car, a yacht, a pony, etc." so, if roy was truthful, he would spend a mass of money on his girl. this song is dedicated to that mindset, and to all those guys in those types of relationships. let me just clarify: this, thank god, is not how my relationship is with my fiance. it is just the stereotypical relationship with girls.
Female:100.00%, Male, sometimes things are perfect. when you find something perfect you then realize the other experiences you might compare to, you thought were perfect, weren’t. they might have been really good or above expectation, but not perfect. at 37 and a lover of food and restaurants i can count on one hand the number of perfect dining experiences. it takes a lot to pull it all together; location, atmosphere, food, drink, numerous employees that all have to be on target and in tune with you and your party. so here is the place i now get to add to my perfect spots: canoe. here are the moments i want to capture (and i will not go through all of them as there many more highlights): the grounds were beautiful. i know, grounds. i come from southern cal where grounds are the parking lot and the shrubs in front. canoe is on the chattahoochee river in atlanta georgia, nestled in a community of incredible estate homes. there is a walking path that winds through lawns with lovely flowers and plants all under the shade of mature trees. they even had set some tables out on the lawn for a small party of 4 couples. they were right next to the water front a good 50 feet from the back porch of the building. while i was there they set up the tables and seated the 8. they seemed to really enjoy themselves and it was hard not to be impressed with this extra effort of having the wait staff travel the distance. 
Female:100.00%, Female, for example, there was a friend who was committed to some guy. and then we happened to ask this girl whether she was sure that this was the guy she wished to be with even after say, 10 years. the answer was 'no'. then, why? the question is why? why do people stick with people, get into a relation, have fun, and then break up? i don't say that all people are the same, and many of them are faithful, but there are many who are not. and even if we recognize the true colours of people, why do we keep passing on time in futile? time pass? is that the motive of all this? love is so fuckin' blind? are we stupid? yes. amen. there was another guy who claims that he had a break up with his girl because that girl hated his doggy and hence, she dumped him. now. where is co-operation? adjustment? what is love? 0_o people might ask me to ease down a bit, and take things a bit lightly. they might tell me that i am too serious about life. but hell, atleast i think a couple of times before wasting my time on something or someone. why holler around with something or someone with no purpose what-so-ever? another example: friend showing all the smses of a drunk lover: "ohh maan...your hazel eyes...and your lips...blu blu..bli bli bli...bla bla..." she laughed at him. and i laughed back loud like an immature oaf. and it seems to be a claimed fact that at the peak of teenage, you are supposed to take the opposite sex a bit lightly. every romeo, every cribbing lover happens to be a bastard within with verses of satan running through his blood. ahan. we girls(i mean, my species of girls) don't like it when a guy just uses the ladies and we love the 'one man for a life time'-and-the-blah-blah philosophy. but there are girls who can bet on their life to claim that we have to be treated the way we are being treated right now. a girl herself told a guy, that this is the age where we are supposed to know how the opposite sex is, and just hang out with her, and do 'time pass', and not to get too serious about her(say, expert guidance in misguiding the people trudging on right paths). alright, everyone seems to be stuffed up with the same shit. not cool. this seems so correct to most of the people, surprisingly. but for me, it seems so utter rubbish. seems like some unwritten law. not cool. it's crappy and unnerving.
Male:98.30%, Male, early 20's and just moved from the small town to the big city. i have two jobs working in sports radio as well as at a college sports tv station in the greatest city of all, chicago. college graduate of north central college, class of 2008. high school graduate of coal city high school, class of 2004. not a whole lot else to know about me. although i no longer play any actual sports i do enjoy pick up games of basketball and 7 on 7 football as well as being the best 16" softball player in all of chicago. any other questions, ask me. 
Male:99.97%, Male, have you ever wondered what is your purpose, beyond "what god has in store for you" or whatever your religion says. some people would say to make better in the world, but others really don't believe they have much of a purpose. my thought is that its genetically ingrained into us to drive on to do whatever is in our power to keep the race alive. in essence we're clinging to life like some sort of single-celled life form, such as a disease. all that disease does is travel from host to host until it dies. our "hosts" are what drives us to strive onward, for example: money, drugs, sex, the people we love, whatever you want. with that comes darwin's theory of evolution. if we just keep reproducing, theoretically after maybe millions of years we'd evolve to adapt to what would be essential for survival. that leaves the question... is there a 'perfect specimen? could we attain a level of never needing anything to survive and if so, would that mean immortality? it's an interesting question, something to ponder upon. once immortality is achieved, the primal need to survive will have been fulfilled. and we are still left to wonder, what is our purpose? 
Female:100.00%, Male, well, here i am, back at home sitting in my favourite chair. back to normality, whatever that may be. the good news is that i did manage to drag myself out of bed at a sensible time, and even had enough time for some breakfast before we left the flat for the last time. we did go for one last look at the beach before we jumped in the car and began the long journey home. i drove for the first hour and a half! as far as scotch corner services in fact. this is, i think, the longest i have ever driven in one go, my previous longest being the hour from our house to derby. i thought i did pretty well, and i only managed to scare sally once - well, the bloke in front shouldn't have braked while i was checking the mirror should he?! saly drove the rest of the way home, and we got home around 2pm, which was earlier than we expected to - 4 and a half hours in total - a good 30 or so minutes less than we thought it would take - mind you, in the 90 minutes i spent driving we shifted a bit!! ;-)
Female:100.00%, Female, i don't wanna get hung up on details, or this thing could get long and complicated, so i'll start with some highlights. christmas morning was lovely and peaceful. the boy is sweet and gracious, and he was so good all day that i'm still not sure it wasn't a coma dream. or that ward drugged him... i know for sure though, that drugged is the way to celebrate, as a started getting hit with a cold on wednesday night, and dosed myself with dayquil all day yesterday. it slowed my mind just enough that it was like i was watching a home movie. it was marvelous, really. 
Female:54.69%, Male, i think that the book of job was written for this very reason. here we have a man who is deeply blessed of god. things have gone so very well for him. and suddenly it all goes wrong. not just slightly but deeply and in every way. has he done wrong? has he been spurned by god? no! job is never able to see the heavenly things. he is never shown the events of satan's desire to tempt, and test job. he is not shown god's pleasure in job's upright living. he is never shown any of these things. but he is called to trust that god is in control no matter what. he is in control and powerfully good even if our feelings are wrong. it is a beautiful test to be given the opportunity to have faith even in the depths of this dark night of the soul. we are called to yell out like job from the ashes. "he said, “naked i came from my mother’s womb, and naked i will return there. the lord gives, and the lord takes away. may the name of the lord be blessed!” in all this job did not sin, nor did he charge god with moral impropriety." (job 1:21-22) why do we think that just because he doesn't feel close that he is not close? why do we place so much emphasis on feeling? as if it was the deciding factor in our salvation, or god's relationship to us. 
Female:100.00%, Female, sometimes i feel like willie lohman, only i'm much happier. i've been on the road since the end of february. i flew to bwi (baltimore international airport), spent a night or two with friends in dc, and then began my journey down to south florida. after an 8 hour drive i spent the night in st. george, sc. after a morning of not taking advantage of the free processed food , but loving the free treadmill, i ventured on down to daytona, where bike week was in full swing. friends had rented a gorgeous house in an old neighborhood, with huge oaks and pines and imaginary bobcats. the minute i entered florida on hwy 95 i was engulfed in nostalgia. i remembered walking hand in hand with paul on the mayport beach at the intersection of canal and atlantic. we later took the same walk when i was pregnant and we conversed about how excited i was to be introducing a soul to our wayfarer lifestyle with all it's beauty and spontaneity. in daytona, my girlfriend & i visited the legendary iron horse saloon, it is what i refer to as "thunder dome". again, i was taken back to another year, another time, pre- adrian. it was the year 1999 when i first entered this bar with it's multi level swing bridges and burn out pits and i knew for sure that tina turner would come swinging down any minute. my next stop took me to one of the equestrian capitols of the world. it was great seeing old friends and catching up. my greatest fun, was visiting nicky. i trained nicky to take over my job as a shore excursion tour director for the cruise ships in st. thomas in 1999. she was then my boss as the atlantis submarine, a real submarine that took 54 people down 90 feet to a fed coral reef. nicky now works as a director for a privately owned cruise ship for the elite billionaires of the world. we had a blast. she's from whales and we are comfortable enjoying a good cuppa. i'm staying in florida longer than expected. weather and expectations may be better. traveling for hours at a time with no dial on the radio worthwhile, with lots to ponder and a journal for contemplating. when the day is done it is satisfying and rewarding. good friends, good memories, lots of self exploration. 
Female:100.00%, Female, what else? hmmmmm....oh, i had an interesting string of conversations with alyssa recently. apparently my aunt snapped a couple weeks ago and sent aly the longest email ever as an attempt to make amends with her. they haven't gotten along for years and years. alyssa was so upset by the email that she sent it to me for some advice. it was such a slap in the face. i talked on the phone with her for over an hour, two different days. actually, both days i ended up sitting out in my car in the driveway. that is my weird solution to preventing myself from pacing when i'm on the phone for a long time. eventually our conversation got away from the bullshit with her mom and we caught up about everything else. alyssa is yet another person that i can talk to about anything. i guess i'm really lucky in that way. why is it that so many great conversations take place while in the car? maybe it's just me, but i've had some friendship-changing conversations on a late-night drive on a long road. i have a really fun week ahead of me. i'm seeing my very first broadway show, and i'm taking a roadtrip to a place i've never been before. hopefully some of the things that i've ordered as christmas and birthday (and baby shower) gifts will start showing up in the mail. i want a better idea of the dent i've made in my holiday shopping. ok, soooooo, yeah. i guess that's all for now. 
Female:100.00%, Female, even when i first started, the lunches were much better than your average school lunch. the kitchen exclusively served organic milk and yogurt, and the salad bar always had lettuce, tomatoes, and other fresh vegetables. even with a few great items in the cafeteria, it still has a long way to go. the majority of students and staff eat food from the main meal line, and the food is just a small step up from an average school lunch. hot dogs, hamburgers, nuggets, and pizza are monthly mainstays. yes, the hot dogs might be lower sodium and the buns are made with whole wheat, but healthy and nutritious, they are not. before taking this job, i worked in a few upscale restaurant kitchens as a cook, pastry chef, and sous chef. i rarely cooked at home, and i ate pretty poorly during those years. it made me wonder why i was cooking in the first place. i would never have guessed i would end up working in a school cafeteria five years ago. new york city was just beginning to revamp its school lunch program when i was finishing up culinary school. they were hiring at my culinary school’s career fair. i was interested, but i didn’t linger at their booth too long. why would i spend two years of my life learning to cook and then work for a school, where little cooking is done on premises? several years later and exhausted from twelve hour days feeding a select few restaurant-goers, i began to think about school food. i heard more and more about people like alice waters and ann cooper. i taught a free cooking class for high school students and their stories reminded me how bad school lunch can be. at some point, tackling a stagnant school food system seemed much more interesting than making truffle risotto day in and day out.
Female:100.00%, Female, this morning i gave someone a gift which spread a smile across their face. that was the best feeling ever, to know that making a small amount of effort would improve their day dramatically! i am of course talking about mother's day. today i gave my mum a 2ft card and a small teddy bear (which she's now called aristotle..!), and the smile that came on her face was brilliant :) i'm really glad she likes it, and today things seem to be a lot more on the up for her, which is a relief considering last week. as for myself, well today is another day of normality. i'm dying for a week saturday to come, when unbelievably huge deadlines are out of the way. every night of this week is going to be dedicated to making some form of draft of my dissertation. i know fully well it won't be anywhere near the standard my final draft will be, but heck, why not make the effort and get some useful feedback. i got a 2.2 for the dissertation report that i did, which was 20% of my overall dissertation grade. granted, it was a low 2.2, but heck, it could've been a 3rd! so that's given me a bit of a boost. i know fully well my stress levels will go through the roof this week because of my work, but i'll manage hopefully :) and the weekend will bring some much needed relaxation and giggles! 
Female:100.00%, Female, recently, spm resultt released. those people around me, have a great result. this make me stress. i stress, not because i scared and hate the feeling of lose. i stress as i don't want to disappoint my parents. they have been putting a lots of hope on me, since i get i a great result at kinder garden. it also mean, my childhood is in stress. though, i appreciate what they have done. thanks mum, dad. although stress, i suppose i will go through it by myself. i will try my best to not disappoint u all. bro, thanks for your support. you are the best brother in the world. spm,me, rainie, never scare of you. as what asson say, angel is always by my side. 
Female:100.00%, Female, i've been running this off and on cold for three days now. it started with immense fatigue and soreness, so i thought it was the flu, but then it never digressed into upper-respiratory torture? then on saturday it was nonexistent, then today i feel sick again (but still no nose slobber). maybe it's some order of slow burning swine flu that in a week or two will finally come around to making me do my sickness hibernation techniques. so i have my very own apartment now and all of you should be fucking proud of me, because other than that one time in asheville (some of you may affectionately remember the hemp-hill home) i have never done this all on my own before. and i do mean all on my own, down-posits, rent, contracts. talking to them. you know, stuff adults do. i'm going to paint the walls purple and put those glow in the dark stars on my ceiling. christmas lights will be a-plenty. i already have some dank smelling candles from ikea that stank up the apartment like crisp cinnamon apple (and now it smells like a thousand cinnamon orgasms). i live in nw balls deep in the city and i wouldn't have it any other way. 
Female:100.00%, Male, this concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens't make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. i am one. eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended!last night hanging out with friends was awesome! derek and i cruised through our alma mater, went to the mall, cruised back through, told stories, laughed, had genuine great conversation, and then met friends for pizza. it was awesome. i saw people i hadn't seen in years. my abs hurt this morning because i laughed so much yesterday. i think derek is the funniest person i know. and that was amazing. and then today i get a letter in the mail from unemployment. i've been denied benefits. fml. and tonight we're getting together for an "i have too much alcohol in my house and you all should come drink it" party at my friend katie's house. so...it's perfect timing.
Female:99.99%, Female, i am honored that my painting “the divine mother” (4' x 8', acrylics) has caused such controversy. the theme of the 2007 artery exhibit in eureka springs, ar was icons, and i chose to paint what i believe to be one of the most beautiful and inspirational iconographic themes that transcends the world of art to include the history of mankind— the simple and beautiful image of a woman breastfeeding her child. the judges at the portfolios.com creative awards, an international competition, also found this to be beautiful and gave me an award for this painting (illustration '08). since ancient times, people have been so inspired by the beauty of this image that incredible myths and religious stories and artwork have been created, even worshipped. this includes depictions of the egyptian goddess isis breastfeeding baby horus, an ancient myth which bears striking similarity to and which many scholars say inspired the madonna del latte or maria lactans imagery of europe, which reached the height of its popularity in the middle ages. i title my painting “the divine mother,” though it is not a depiction of the virgin mary, as many people erroneously believe. the virgin mary is just one divine mother icon of many; my divine mother is one of unity, love, gentleness, compassion—and so she combines world traditions and religions, transcending time and space, melding pre-christian religions with christianity to be an icon we can all identify with and find peace and beauty with. look closely at her face—it is half-blue (many egyptian statues of isis are blue) , and she is wearing egyptian makeup. as many people have noticed, i put a new twist on this subject by adding the text “does this halo make my face look fat?” to the painting. the madonna lactans and isis imagery began as a way to show the compassion of the divine mother and therefore to make her more real, human, and accessible to us. adding the text was my attempt to refresh and modernize this theme—to make her accessible, relevant, and real to a modern audience. the divine mother, in all her forms, is undeniably the greatest supermodel of the art world since the beginning of mankind—so i believe that like you, she worries about how she looks in a painting, photograph, or sculpture!
Female:100.00%, Female, a question for god looms in my mind like water rolling and spinning; chortling into an abyss of time. when i was nineteen i was dying so that i could live. i survived this challenge to come through this lifetime with the knowledge that god is within. i was a college student, home for the summer and had gone to a party. at that party there was drinking and pot smoking. a good friend’s boy friend had come on to me and i was tempted to flirt back. in fact, i did flirt back. i was young. i was beautiful and i was an atheist. a year earlier my longest childhood friend had a swimming pool accident which left her a paraplegic. my friend, the athlete was changed forever and i felt guilty. it was the unreasonable kind of guilt that summons over the young just because it can and it did. my friend was changed and i too changed. i grew angry, and in a way i became uncaring about life itself. i learned years later that often when we have profound thoughts they can manifest into reality. my thoughts at that time were, “why didn’t it happen to me?” that night of drunken partying with a cute boy who was supposedly attached to a good friend i got into my car to drive home and through no fault of my own was hit. suddenly my car flew out of control spinning around and around in the darkened summer night. i sat in the driver’s seat with voices going through my mind of my father and my brother, “don’t do this....do that!” paralyzed i began to pray, “dear god! i don’t know what to do! help me!” in that moment i gave up my arrogance and went into complete surrender and when i did that an extreme and blinding white shield of light came directly out of my chest surrounding me like an egg shell. the car continued to spin and finally slammed into an apartment building narrowly missing a telephone pole. i jumped out of the car mainly to see if i could still walk. my car was totaled, but i was okay. the man who had hit me had been “joy racing” with another driver going over 90 miles per hour and i had inadvertently gotten into his way. 
Female:100.00%, Female, being that my school is on a year round schedule, there is always one "track" of kids not at the school for a few weeks at a time. though i like the sporadic breaks here and there, a small void is always felt for those fellow teachers you work with that are gone for a few weeks. so a few times this school year, a group of my work friends have met up at the cheesecake factory for random visits with friends that we have been missing at work. last week, a cheesecake factory trip was planned for this week to play catch up with some of our dear track 4 (off track) teachers. . . or so i thought. . . i should have been a little suspicious when one teacher wished me a happy birthday today at work. . .." uhhh thanks. . . but a few weeks late! where are you getting this information?" well. . . my brain got a thinking, and sure enough. . . i found myself at cheesecake factory dinner not in honor of missing our friends (though i think that is still a big part of it), but rather for a happy birthday shawna dinner! the food was good, the dessert was even better, but the company was by far the best! these ladies have truly become some of my favorite people that i can go to for a laugh or a cry during a time in my life where i have no super close friends in proximity. today was by far a rather crappy day at work, but who can understand what im going through better than this group of people? they really know how to make a person feel much better about themselves. who would've guessed that a two week late birthday dinner could be such perfect timing?? by the end of the night i even got one of them to agree to become a garbage man with me as long as i drive and let her ride the back! awww. . . now that's what friends are for! 
Female:100.00%, Female, having mono during school has been really difficult for me. i am constantly tired. not only is it hard for me to wake up in the morning, it's hard for me to find the motivation to go to class, study and get work done. the doctor said the fatigue could go away in 2 weeks and it could last for 3 months. it's been almost 3 weeks and i feel just as tired as before. i can already tell that this is not going to be a dean's list semester. i'm disappointed with myself, but i feel so helpless. i can't even ask my teachers for a break because uhs won't give me permission to miss any classes. not only is my academic life suffering, but so is my social life and my emotional well-being. i don't have the energy to straighten my hair any more and my self-esteem takes a hit every time i look in the mirror. i think the huge bags underneath my eyes are permanent. the apartment is a mess too, which i can't live with. cluttered house, cluttered mind. you're supposed to lose weight with mono, but all i can do is sit on the couch and i'm not allowed to exercise, so i fear i'm gaining weight. i need to turn this around. this is a challenge. if i got dean's list this semester, i would be incredibly proud of myself. i know i shouldn't be straining myself, but i need to push myself because right now, i'm not really pushing myself at all. 
Male:100.00%, Male, i understand that while the first few days might be typical for a class, it shortly becomes their hardest and most grueling block with the pure mass of data they require you to learn. this weeds out anyone that can't handle the workload right off, and anyone who is not serious about animation. it also gives student a good strong base to start with the 2nd block, which i understand to be mostly animation and mocap. i think 3rd block covers the more advanced features, like visual effects and green screen. and finally, 4th block is one big long class project. students have very limited creativity in the class assignments. while they are encouraged to come in before or after class, and on weekends, to work on their own projects, so they can build their demo reel up and their skills, the class itself acts more like an actual animation studio, where the directors call the shots, and the animators have to make it happen. therefore, we have to act like animators to make their vision come true. students will have some limited creativity within each shot, but the majority of it is just to make the scene work the way it should. 
Female:68.27%, Female, as i've been gleefully exclaiming to all and sundry on my youtube channel, yesterday i went for some afternoon tea (the very phrase conjures pomposity unlimited and therefore regally requires capital letters) at a very posh hotel in london with an intimidating dress code and a price list even more so. so finally, after a lot of to-ing and fro-ing and wandering about the flat in semi-constructed and poorly-considered outfit choices, we finally managed to mobilise our troops and begin our expedition to somewhere a little different. i held kiwi's hand as we nervously shuffled past the doormen of the connaught hotel and crossed the threshold, half expecting to be rebuffed by a cross-looking moustache in a top hat and tails, or for the unsmiling host blocking our entry to our desired destination to tell us that we were unsuitably attired, or our reservation could not be located. feeling none of the bravado of red riding hood, i felt a little lost in the woods as we were ushered to a seat and sat down before my seat was pushed in. luckily there was no slapstick tumble to the floor, rather an awkward pause as i calculated the distance between myself and the table, and the danger of dropping one of those so-carefully prepared pastries into that unavoidable gap. i stood up awkwardly and let the nice lady with the grey suit push my chair in a little further.
Female:100.00%, Female, there's so much to say. every little nuance of life becomes exaggerated when you're in the hospital. every interaction becomes multiplied in meaning. every small exchange between me and the saviors-in-scrubs became a desperate reliance on their expertise and kindness. i feel like the hospital is the gateway from death into brith and life into death. i was born in one and i've been near death in many. my hospital visits for my various illnesses and surgeries are like the punctuations in my rambling life. yesterday's surgery went well and by well i mean my knee should be improving and i didn't die. my surgeon explained the "mess" my knee was in. there was the "fracture" in the cartilage, fairly new (happened 11 months ago) that needed to be cleaned up. then there was the bone-on-bone arthritis that had to be dealt with. meniscus shavings were all over the place causing pain and inflammation. he cleaned up what best he could. we'll be doing protein injections in about a month to ease the arthritis. i'm optimistic. the pain is pretty bad but i have plenty of pain killers. i was urged to take them and to get rest. no need to be the tough-guy by not taking the meds. see, pain is a signal to the body that something is wrong. pain puts the body in crisis mode. fight or flight crisis responses do not facilitate healing. taking the pain killers and resting tells the body that it's time to heal. now if only i would stop fussing around the house and get some rest!! 
Female:100.00%, Female, the second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. i realized the second man was mentally challenged and the blue-eyed gentleman was his salvation. i held my tears as i stood there with them. the young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. he said, 'coffee is all miss' because that was all they could afford. (if they wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up, they had to buy something. he just wanted to be warm). then i really felt it - the compulsion was so great i almost reached out and embraced the little man with the blue eyes. that is when i noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. i smiled and asked the young lady behind the counter to give me two more breakfast meals on a separate tray. i then walked around the corner to the table that the men had chosen as a resting spot. i put the tray on the table and laid my hand on the blue-eyed gentleman's cold hand. he looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, 'thank you.' i leaned over, began to pat his hand and said, 'i did not do this for you. god is here working through me to give you hope. i started to cry as i walked away to join my husband and son. when i sat down my husband smiled at me and said, 'that is why god gave you to me, honey, to give me hope..' we held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that only because of the grace that we had been given were we able to give. in my own way i had touched the people at mcdonald's, my son,the instructor, and every soul that shared the classroom on the last night i spent as a college student. 
Male:100.00%, Male, for those of you who thought luke harangody was bound for nba greatness and never going to play a game for the fighting irish again, you were wrong. after testing out the nba routine, working out for a few different teams, harangody has decided that staying in college is not such a bad idea after all. i'm not going to say that this is a great move either way for #44. what i do know is that his lack of defensive ability would have severely hurt his potential minutes on an nba court next winter. he has proved that he can score in the big east and grab absurd amounts of rebounds. however, he needs to be more of a defensive threat if he hopes to play in "the league" for any extended amount of time. i'm not bashing luke harangody, the kid is one helluva college basketball player who has been as good as any in the big east over the past two seasons. his body size puts him at an extreme disadvantage for a big man in the nba in terms of being able to back down opponents and score the same way he does so often in big east play. the good news for fighting irish fans is that in the big east even you are able to get away more with some of the flaws that nba souts see in harangody's game and that next year should be another outstanding offensive campaign for the fighting irish forward. 
Male:100.00%, Male, i figured while i was unemployed, i would try to do something useful. one thing i thought somebody might benefit from was a facebook page that gives advice on finding a job. (here's the link) then i thought about the things going through my mind these days as i struggle to stay positive and engaged in the face of a job market that isn't exactly smiling upon those over 40. finding a job in this economy is tough for anybody, but being over 40, you might start asking yourself things like, "do they think i'm too old to do this?" well, listen, now you have a chance to prove to them that you are capable, talented, and right for the job. some people develop a lot of negative self-talk and that negative attitude begins to show through on the surface. not many employers can afford to hire someone who is late to work, can't spell, doesn't produce results, has so much drama in their life they aren't present at work, etc. so you're still in the game, old-timer! i created the over 40 unemployed facebook fan page as a place where people (you don't have to be over 40 and unemployed) can share their experience, their strategies, their job search tips, and their success stories. i believe that in this economy, if you're over 40 and unemployed then all the more reason to work harder and work smarter. it's a chance to show how all those years of "experience" can benefit a potential employer. and here's the logo i created for the over forty and unemployed facebook page:
Female:99.61%, Female, well i was just sitting here wondering what the next step is. anybody that knows me will tell you that i'm a person who likes things planned out. but at this time in my life i am not the one in charge of making the plans. i have met a wonderful guy who treats me like gold. but when will he ask me to be his wife? i have gotten my diabetes under control. but when will god make me a mother? i have worked so hard on getting to this point in my life i just wonder what's the next step?
Female:81.08%, Male, today was an absolutely gorgeous day... i aerated much of the lawns and over-seeded them as well... i will finish in the morning. i wanted it completed before saturday as we will go from 60's back into the 30's with rain and a possible snow storm. there is way too much to water in the seeds and i will have to leave that to spring rains. i'm not particularly concerned about the cold, as magnolia buds don't appear to be swelling... at least not yet. i thought i'd talk a bit today about fall planting....why plant in the fall? the answer is a simple one... deals, deals, and more deals!! ... and when the deal isn't to my liking, i simply say... 'let’s make a deal'... and frequently they do. let's discuss this past fall for instance. below is a whole lot of plants that i got for 50-75% off. this particular nursery was having a sale and not discussing lowering the prices any further.... but they were cheap enough to spur me into the purchase. the downside is that there was no warranty... then again, i seldom lose a plant that has been carefully chosen. a good shot of rooting hormone and they seem to take right off! 
Female:100.00%, Male, bella is over the chicken pox. she returned to school today. all said, it was a very manageable case. not super-mild, but not super-bad either. perhaps it took having the chicken pox to nudge bella over the edge of readiness to ride a bike without training wheels. in the midst of the pox, she asked me to take the training wheels off. she practiced coasting in the driveway. the next day, she was getting the start-off and some wobbly pedaling down. yesterday, she had nailed it. she's still perfecting the brakes, but she has completely mastered the start-off, pedaling, and steering. now it's time to get her a bigger bike. as you can see in this video, hers is too small. i'm not sure if she'll get one for ayyam-i-ha, which is less than 2 weeks away. it might wait till her birthday in june. although with us packing up to move, she might get a "bike coupon" for her birthday, redeemable in whatever city we move to. 
Female:100.00%, Female, i want this on my body, i want a tattoo, i want a lot of tattoos. first of them has to be a simple heart on my right foot to carry on a simple tradition. ya see my best friend from the age of about three is going to carry on the tradition of the "foot heart tattoo" or whatever it is and i have agreed to embark on this with her. so i cant start my ink filled journey without her.. the journey should start soon... hopefully. so with no direction and the never ending search for a career path growing more and more difficult i have decided to vent.. to blog. a bit about myself i am a student, studying who knows what at this moment. transcript says in store for my next semester is french, sign language, english 300 and 302 magic, witchcraft and religion, and fitness. we'll see how that goes. i have a strong passion for languages, and culture. i would love to be a reporter, or a medic, a translator, a psychiatrist, i'd love to do it all. first i have to settle on a major, at the moment i am thinking a double major in communications and international relations. or linguistics. this is going to be harder than i thought.. well i that's it for now i have to call it a day i have a job interview tomorrow. wish me luck. 
Female:99.98%, Male, one of the reasons is that we are all different. when we hear someone telling us something difficult they are going through, we usually think, "well, i would do this, and things would be fine," but we aren't the other person. it happens alot with disagreements, too. we think to ourselves, "i would never do that to someone else." true, you wouldn't but they might. empathy is moving our "self" filter that we see life through aside, and trying to understand where the other person may be coming from. i admit, i am the worst person when it comes to putting my emotional response on hold, and trying to understand where the other person is coming from. did i grow up with them? did i have their parents? their family? did they have any issues along the way that may effect the way they deal with difficulties? my wife got exasperated with my male, "fix the problem" response to her issue, and told me to, "just listen". i'm better than i used to, but i still react in my male dna way. however, empathy is more than listening - it is taking a step or two to understand where someone is coming from. do you have a friend/family/co-worker that seems to be constantly involved in the same issue or situation. it seems like they are on a racetrack life path that takes them around and around through the same situation. to me, you have two ways to deal with it; 
Male:100.00%, Male, i follow a lot about politics and i despise, yet appreciate the strategy behind the rhetoric. however, i don't know if i've ever been more disgusted by a blatant attempt to mislead followers into a false sense of appreciation than what metallica is now attempting to do on youtube. after having spent years suing any fan or distribution outlet they could find who mentioned their work online, they have now taken the obvious plunge into the realm of "if can't beat 'em, join 'em" with the hopes that fans won't realize their record. watch lars choke back his resentment of his publicist in the video below. seems genuine enough, don't you think? please, stop spending money supporting this band. they are the epitome of why the recording industry is missing the point and destroying itself by mistreating fans. they are now embracing tools they have fought against not because they believe in them or appreciate what they facilitate, but because they see the possibility of the revenue it will bring them. makes my skin crawl a bit. 
Female:100.00%, Female, last night i was overjoyed to see that the snowpeas that i’ve been cultivating for about 4 months now are finally bearing fruit. like me, they’ve had to show a lot of determination in a place with so little arable land! boxed in next to my window in a little window-size container they are now happily producing. i can’t wait to taste them. to celebrate the occasion, i’ve asked two friends for dinner next week. i’ve already tried the lettuce i’ve been growing, and to be honest, it didn’t seem like anything special, but my friends pronounced it very “fresh!” it seems like things might be turning a corner for me as well. for most of this month i’ve been able to come home before the sky turned black, my email inbox has never gone over 101 unopened messages, i’ve finally gotten most of my address changes done and my christmas decorations are finally down! i’m hopeful that my growing understanding of school life and the reduction of my weekly hours will enable me to have something left to give or do after the day’s work is over. thank you, lord! 
Female:99.80%, Female, i'm not exactly sure what to feel at this point. as a little girl you grow up believing your father is like superman and nothing can hurt him except for kryptonite. as you get older of course, that belief fades and you realize that he is human just like everyone else. but a part of you still wants to hold on to it. watching my father in that hospital bed made me truly understand how fragile life truly is..........i'm going to miss my daddy.........i hope he found a happier place to be.
Male:99.86%, Male, this is purely an opportunity for me to stand up and admit i was wrong. a couple of seasons ago i would watch arsenal play and spend a good 80 minutes of the game going: 'we need to get rid of denilson, eboue and song they're absolutely awful. why can't wenger see that?!' now i only spend 20 minutes of the game complaining, and that's only when denilson's on the pitch. since song has been suspended we've looked decidedly dodgy in the middle of the park. yes of course that also has to do with the absence of fabregas (and to some degree ramsey), but song has grown over the last 2 seasons to become a talented rock of a midfielder and he has finally come into his own. he's taken on the role left by the ridiculous departure of flamini (who?) and we are a weaker unit without him. yes he has his shaky moments where you're left asking why he made a forward run leaving a gap at the back, or when he puts the ball out for a stoke throw when he could have passed it back to almunia. all in all though my faith has been restored in all things wenger. he is with the players day in day out on the training field and i am not. everybody was questioning his re-signing of sol campbell. it's now officially the best signing of a quiet january transfer window. without sol we probably would have lost at stoke.
Male:100.00%, Male, in the fitness and nutrition field it's vital that you continue to educate so science doesn't pass you by. new research is reviewed and released almost every day that can have a lasting effect on your programming, so where do you go to keep up? i link to many of my favorite sources on the sidebar, but there are a few that haven't made it up yet. here's a short list of some that i've found educational: the fitcast : http://thefitcast.com/ i've been able to listen to snippets of their podcasts on my short drive to work, and the knowledge that kevin, leigh, dr. fass, and sometimes tony bring to the table is wonderful. weekly interviews with top industry professionals brings the listener several different views on varying topics. it's also great that, should i feel the need, i can just drop them a few questions to answer on the next episode. go ahead and subscribe to the podcast through itunes and see what it's all about. they each have their own blogs that i've found to be very informative. 
Female:100.00%, Female, sometimes we wonder, 'what did i do to deserve this?' or 'why did god have to do this to me?' here is a wonderful explanation! a daughter is telling her mother how everything is going wrong, she's failing algebra, her boyfriend broke up with her and her best friend is moving away. meanwhile, her mother is baking a cake and asks her daughter if she would like a snack, and the daughter says, 'absolutely mom, i love your cake.' 'here, have some cooking oil,' her mother offers. 'yuck' says her daughter. 'how about a couple raw eggs?' 'gross, mom!' 'would you like some flour then? or maybe baking soda?' 'mom, those are all yucky!' to which the mother replies: 'yes , all those things seem bad all by themselves.. but when they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully delicious cake! ' god works the same way. many times we wonder why he would let us go through such bad and difficult times. but god knows that when he puts these things all in his order, they always work for good! we just have to trust him and, eventually, they will all make something wonderful! god is crazy about you. he sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning. whenever you want to talk, he'll listen. he can live anywhere in the universe, and he chose your heart. i don't know who wrote this, it was sent to me and i wanted to share .. cute! i just wanted to remind you all that if you need prayer or just someone to talk to just send me a message! i'm here for you! alrighty tell me what you thought of this! tell me about your ingredients!! 
Female:99.51%, Male, a few days ago i showed ronald and cale...two eight year olds that are rapidly becoming a pain in the ass...how to make tin can telephones. they come around often now wanting to know about more 'new' and 'neat' things. today they discovered my bomb shelter...yeah, i got a bomb shelter here; a real built in maybe the early fifties bomb shelter. underground over there to the north thirty-six steps away from the house; just a big concrete box in the ground with a steel door, concrete steps leading down, air pipes and such sticking out of the top. ronald and cale were tagging along behind me this afternoon and fate led me over that way. "what"s that?" hollered cale, staring down the shelter steps. if i had been hooked up to a lie detector, i'd have said the same thing: "that's where my vampire lives," i said. there is no electronic instrument on the market today that could have measured the speed with which two young set of eyebrows shot up at that news, and i swear the temperture dropped a few degrees from the cold chills running up and down a couple of small backs. my offer of letting them go down there and peep in at my vampire was flatly refused. ronald and cale are of the modern world; they know not to screw around with vampires. but if the cops show up here any time soon inquiring about vampires, i'm gonna know right off the bat who ratted me out. 
Male:100.00%, Female, i recently received an email regarding being catholic and boycotting the latest instalment of the series that sent many a devout catholic seething into pits of rage (one of the 7 deadly sins, ironically). funny though, in a related link, the vatican doesn't seem to care too much. is this a case of a different kind of crucifixion in today's age of finding an identity? 
Female:99.89%, Female, the person that shares my life and space on occasion, just happens to be named on deed and possession, as i am on theirs. a protection thing for both of us, assuring that the other will oversee all, if one of us cannot. we share the space of the abode, bedroom each (though somehow i got the small one without the walkin closet.) and we share the computer/office room and the other open spaces of the house. but, it seems i type too loud, and so the other must move office and their computer to another space, and i can keep the old. but, though the big bedroom is twice the size of mine, there seems not enough room for all the office equipment. so, additional space is claimed for that purpose, half the sunporch/entertainment room. the rational being, "it's half my house and you have your room, the computer room, the living room, the kitchen, and i need more space for meetings and connsultations, etc . ." . . .but . . .seems to me some of that "my" space is joint, enjoyed by both. i do not want the sunroom halved, for the purpose of providing more office space, when there was already room enough in the computer room. and, i do not type too loud . .not always. the sunroom is a many-windowed and sunny room with views in three directions, also giving access to the yard and pool. the best room in the house (not counting the other bedroom with walkin closet) i am impossible. i am selfish. it is not about me. i fear i shall soon be part owner of a duplex. 
Male:100.00%, Male, most everyone around the world is prejudice in different ways, some more extreme than others; but no matter how extreme the prejudice is it will always have a negative effect. people have always had and will always have their differences, but we do not have to be so ignorant and discriminate against different ideas, races, sexual orientation, or religions;(even though most denominations cause discrimination themselves.)though i also don't agree with people slapping other people in the face with their life styles. whether it be a racist not treating one person as fairly as the other for obvious reasons of being a racist, or a very religious person telling you what their beliefs are for the consequences of your actions while trying to convince you that they are right about what they are telling you.
Male:94.58%, Male, roger conway i have taught language, writing, literature and media studies from the ninth grade through graduate school. the greatest amount of my publishing has been online. i'm currently listed as associate prof. emeritus at southern connecticut state university. 
Female:100.00%, Male, now i know why cats kill birds... current mood: unwanted i don’t know what it is about the birds but it seems like there's not enough room in their nest for me. not only that but in their eyes the old wise owl is losing her wisdom and had led a cat into their tree. that’s not the worst part though... mother hen speaks of me as the creature. she speaks to me of me and see's me as no more than a nucience. i feel so ashamed and poorly of myself for i do not want to disturb the nest. all i want is to find a home. not only a place to live, but a place i prefer to spend my free time instead of trying to find ways to stay out. a place where i am appreciated and loved for who i am, what i did, and what i am going to do. instead, i am swarmed by birds who claim that the cat is untidy and do nothing but stay around and eat. to me, their harsh continuous churpping hurts me more than a step on the tail. all i want is to forget the past and work for my future, but it seems even birds can’t do that... 
Female:100.00%, Male, like i used to disgard people coming back complaining of pain after a hernia op, asking for lots of painkillers, until i had it done myself and geee, i started to appreciate the real pain; since then i always believed in people, apart from the occasionals who are blatently whingers. i have thought nothing of the nausea of mefloquine as an anti-malarial until ... about now. i have just taken one tablet 2 wks before flying away to kenya and already i am feeling.... soooo sick, not yet a vomit, but sick. im feeling the tablet blubbling up and burning in my stomach and i keep on burping. may be i shouldn't have taken it with an empty stomach. this concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens't make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. i am one. eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended! 
Female:100.00%, Male, come, stain my skin. splash the puke you waddle in on my bare back and burn its stench on the parchment with the glowing cigar with smell of steak, drawing smoldering pictures of broken chains and fucked up dreams burnt with jagged edges on the skin and when you burn out the cigar stub it out and flip me over and bite my nipple to suck up the red ink and write more, write bold with your tongue till i drag your head up and kiss you hard claiming the blood that is mine. back.
Female:100.00%, Male, a couple of weeks ago, i was waiting at a traffic light, when a frantic woman came to my window saying she and her family had broken down on the highway; could i help? she needed money. i dipped into my pocket and found a $20 bill and handed it to her and moved on, leaving her behind. did she break down? i don't know. am i a wuss for giving her the cash? probably. but, something has happened to me over the past few years. i've learned from my failures that my successes are not that important, that it's important to stay in the mindset of failure, to be empathetic of those who are not as fortunate and to remember that success is often lucky. so, as i looked at this, i wasn't going to judge. i was going to help. 
Male:99.99%, Male, i loved reading about vijendra singh - the boxer who became popular after winning an olympic medal this year. here is very good write up on his life done by indrani rajkhowa banerjee from times of india. here we go! a rugged village boy who rubs shoulders with the swish set and flirts with bipasha basu, olympiad boxer vijender singh is aware he is an outsider. he is proud of his rustic roots and fights prejudices with charming confidence and a quiet dignity. first things first. what do you look forward to when you set out to interview a hot-blooded jat boxer? you would expect him to look you over and size you up mentally or probably greet you with a few colourful expletives... especially when the guy is a 24-year-old basking in newfound glory. but this one is different. he throws a disarming smile as his eyes meet your eyes and stay right there! that’s vijender singh beniwal for you, india’s lone boxer to have won an olympic medal. 
Female:70.19%, Male, i am becoming intense. it isn't a goal. i don't have a plan toward achieving intensity. it's an observation. i didn't start out this way. i was laid back and relaxed for what i think was most of my life. in fact, there was the time my golf coach encouraged me to develop a temper and some intensity. a sr. minister with whom i worked said i didn't take my mistakes seriously. a lot has changed. i've changed. i am becoming intense. so, i am looking for peace this coming week. i am intentionally seeking silence and peace. i will listen more and speak less. i will think before i react. i will be less intense. i will practice the divine hours. i will remember serenity. i will look to be more at peace. i make a promise to myself.i seem to march into quandaries. i don't think i do it consciously, but the result is the same as if i willfully looked for trouble. it worries me.tomorrow is the primary here in ky. it's irrelevant at this point it seems. the dnc has really messed this whole process up to the point to where a stalemate was bound to occur. still, i am going to the poll tomorrow and i will cast a ballot. i can't bring myself to believe that any vote is irrelevant in a nation that depends on participation.
Male:99.64%, Male, so, by now, i would imagine that if you are reading this, you've probably heard that i am no longer in the kendalville-based metal band, forthcoming. well the rumors are true. i made the decision about a week ago to part from the guys, and get my life on track. there’s still some uncertainty in my head as to how i stand in the eyes of everyone else in the band. here is how i see the situation: i am a devout christian, and everything forthcoming stands for is based around christ, and i love that aspect of the band. second, i couldn't have asked for a greater group of guy to perform with for the year i was in the band. i learned a lot from all of them, and looked to all of them like family. being the youngest in the band by quite a few years, i got to pretty much experience having 3 older brothers that i didn't get to have growing up. joe, jeremy, and jake, no matter what, i'm always going to love you guys. i want you to know that. 
Female:100.00%, Female, friends? i'm the chewing gum stuck to your sole. i'm the rain that soaks your trousers. i'm the crumbs in your bed. i'm the shoelace that breaks when you're in a hurry. i'm the rubbish you forgot to put in the bin. i'm the person who forgets to listen when you talk. i'm the glob of toothpaste on your newly-washed sweater. i'm the song you can't get out of your head. i'm the monotonous sound that wakes you up when you've taken the morning off. i'm the clothes you've become tired of. i'm the shoe that chafes your foot. i'm the food with too many calories. i'm the wind that wrecks your hairdo. i'm all the people who stare when you're feeling sad. i'm the headache the day after. i'm the telephone that rings when you've just fallen asleep. will you still be my friend? 
Female:100.00%, Female, eugh. the past two days, ive seen you twice. you know what, it still kills me. i attempt to talk to you now, and its like nothing. it's like we've never met. i can't believe it all stilled happened. i can't believe i fell for you. what an idiot ay ? we used to be so close. you'd lend me your jacket, walk me home, make sure i gave you a hug and you ran after me when i was upset and we sat and talked for hours. you made me feel so amazing. a feeling ive never felt before. you knew my family, maaaaan didn't they fucking love you. you made sure i was always safe, you took care of me when we out that night in that club, even after what happened at that party. don't tell me you never felt anything for me, cus we both know that's a lie. i just can't believe after everything, our friendship means nothing to you anymore. i miss you. i need to get over you. in my own way i have. i've had to. i just can't believe you were to fucking scared to get it a chance. just remember, if you're ever reading this, you told me once, you couldnt lose anymore people in your life, i understood you, you used to try so hard to make sure we never lost contact. you'd even make the time in your "busy" life to see me after school, and we'd sit in subway chatting about your hard times :/ i can't believe it came to this, we were so close, still could've been, probably would have made my life so much fucking easier. but no, you took the coward's way out, becus you were "too scared" well from now on. i'm never letting you in my life again. you had your chance. i love you. end of. 
Female:99.99%, Male, i'm getting older every day and i am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible. i am husband to 1, daddyo to 5, grand (poppy) to another 5 (so far). i use nikon cameras and lenses ... but i really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with any kind of camera. photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life. it has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation. i am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself. i think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos i capture and in effect "see through my eyes" but for a moment. thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement. i hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills. all of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way. god bless you all.nikonsniper steve 
Female:100.00%, Male, after weeks of planning the day is finally here. yesterday we hung the decorations and started getting everything ready. the party starts tonight at 7pm. you can grab some food at the grilled cheese truck which will be parked outside. inside japan la will be lots of mr toast products to check out, including a new black shaky bacon shirt which was printed up at the last minute by monkey in a dryer! next door to japan la is the mr toast party space, a whole empty store to hang out in. we will have a dj, free pabst blue ribbon beer and even mr toast hanging out so you can take you picture with him. it should be a fun, wonderful, silly event. 
Female:99.98%, Female, ok, how many of you like to receive a nice letter in the mail from a friend? i know i do. even though most of the time i get the mail from the mailbox it is junk mail, i still enjoy the wonder of "will there be a letter?" on small occasions there is a letter that you open and savor. a nice card from a friend far away with actual hand written words, possibly in a colorful pen. you read it once, you read it twice, you may read it everyday for a week or longer. it inspires you to write one back and maybe even write a letter to a different friend. in this technological world we all email, face book, blog, etc..... and don't get me wrong i love them all, but what has happening to letter writing. we say we have no time, but really how many hours do we spend on the computer blogging or facebooking. so why has this art form lost its value? it has lost its value so much that post offices are closing. mail delivery may be shortened by a day. i had the wonderful opportunity to live on martha's vineyard for a period of my life . during that time i was an avid letter writer. nothing like living on a new england island in winter to motivate letter writing. there was this wonderful little store in vineyard haven, called paper tiger. it was filled with uniques cards, papers,pens, stamps and stationary sets. i would walk into town and peruse the store for hours picking out just the right cards for people and write letters. i think i will make someone happy this week and write them a letter and in the mean time support the postal service. just think what would happen if it closed. many books and history have been written and recorded through letters. let's keep our history going! happy writing.
Female:100.00%, Female, i had all these ideas for blog posts about decorating my new house... err, i mean the house we want and are currently in escrow for. you see, this house is thirty years old and absolutely begging for cosmetic work, all in time of course ($$$!). however admist my day dreaming i realized that this house could very well not go through for lord knows what reason. and here i am, planning my life away like i always do. let's focus on the present, april. so ladies and gents, i present you with my new blog layout. i made about five other collages for the header that i may take a vote on, or ask the hubs since my friends on here are quite lacking. yes yes, i know i just renovated this place not too long ago, but i needed something to take my mind off of possibility. i am in control of this layout, you see, and it just feels right. thoughts? i am feeling irritated. perturbed. surrounded by crazy folks (family, patients) and people who want my money (tax time and despicable landlords). so this morning as a means to debrief i turned to a picture of my own version of walden pond, which led me to thoreau; walden and civil disobedience: 
Female:100.00%, Female, now i think about the lives and trials of these women, and then my own. will there be a reward for me, here on this earth? i don't know. there may not be. but i can't live my sick life waiting for it. it's difficult, more difficult than many can imagine. having epilepsy, crohn's, depression, anxiety attacks [which are the worst things on the face of the earth], nightmares, and now back pain and some kind of cold virus. i'm literally *never* healthy. but i take comfort in the fact, the knowledge i am certain of, that one day, i will be completely healed of all my ailments. and i will see regina, and betsy, and little layla grace, and they will all be healthy too, celebrating god's greatness. i look forward to that day. until then, i wait. something i don't like doing, but maybe i'll do some good while i'm at it. it helps, to write my thoughts as i'm going through them. instead of thinking about it all beforehand, just starting and writing, continuing as i realize new things. so, really, this is more for me than anyone else...
Female:100.00%, Female, shopping that is environmentally friendly and easy on the pocket?? why that would be a clothes swap party my friend! yes as the fashion society at uni we decided to host one this week. basically you brings some of your clothes that you no longer wear along and then swap them for somebodys else's castaways et voila you have new gear that didn't cost you a penny! you know what they say one man's rubbish is another's riches...(that is what they say, right?). well anyway it was very successful, i got myself a lovely new bag and jumper out of the deal. i would highly recommend you all try it. i also booked my flights to london with my girls yesterday! we are heading for a short break in the easter hols to treat ourselves to plenty of shopping, sight seeing and show stopping adventures. camden market is on my list of top 5 places in the entire world, so i am very excited to be going back! it's such a mesmerising place, so diverse and exciting. and they have the best doughnut stand i have ever seen. i'm tres excited!
Female:99.87%, Male, i admit that i fall for girls pretty easily. and that has been the cause of many of my relationship downfalls. i think that many women believe that when i open up my feelings that strongly to them that such things aren’t sincere, that this is a product of loneliness. i can’t really blame them. i too have been skeptical of such things when directed at me. and a look at the myriad of different personalities of significant others of my past and i begin to even doubt my own sincerity. but i believe what it really is about me is that i have a tendency to look deeper into the person, to sympathize with their shortcomings, and to fall for the person that i know is in there. i feel that with an open-mind, i can grow to like or love anybody with time. maybe that's my inner counter-culture flower child speaking. it doesn’t help my situation though. i easily make friends and lovers but i can’t keep an intimate companion for the life of me. 
Female:100.00%, Female, ok, so i know that the blog is supposed to be about psychology, but i have another passion, photography. and sometimes the tog in me has to come out and play. like one night last week, when cas came home from school demanding to go out, and gaz suggested we go for a walk. there's a resovoir not too far from us called entwhistle, which is really pretty. so we decided to go there. i grabbed my camera bag with a "i'll only kick myself if i see a shot and haven't got my camera" and off we went. i was soooooo glad i'd grabbed my camera when we got there! the sun was setting and the lake was partly frozen. the light was amazing, the colours were incredible. it was a very slow walk, with my boys sighing every time i lifted the camera again. but i think it was worth it! judge for yourself......
Male:99.98%, Male, i have the idea in my head of what i want the completed piece to look like. however, as this is my first attempt at such an endeavor, it is, as might be expected, taking an inordinate amount of time. at this point though, i'm comfortable enough with my rate of progress to post up the original and declare that soon, the finalized or near-finalized version should be up as well. i hope you enjoy looking at my art, and if you'd like to see more of my abstract designs or rough sketches, please let me know! anything box i collect things that i think are neat or interesting, and i place them in an empty harmonica box in a drawer. recently i was talking to somebody who wanted to see them so i subsequently took this photograph of all the bits in there. i think it looks pretty neat. photobucket i will explain what all the items are starting from the top. the four steel towers at the top are tapered roller bearings from a wheel bearing of a truck. they're made of extremely hard steel which is one reason i kept them. as an experiment, i placed these four in alternate directions between two hard drive magnets. after several months, when i removed them, the atoms had been realigned and the bearings are now notably magnetized. 
Male:93.37%, Female, how was everyone's weekend? well last week i did promise i would 'do' a post (is that proper blog-inology?) about my television work in australia and the us over the past 6 years, so here goes! at the ripe age of 20, fresh out of griffith university where i studied film and media (there you go simon cowell, i am well educated :), i landed my first major gig hosting a daily kids show on the nine network aust. called 'hot source'. this was my training ground for hosting, editing, segment producing, and script writing.my next major move was hosting the daily show 'studio disney' on the disney channel. i loved loved loved this job so much! i was lucky enough to travel around the world and australia, and work with the most amazing team. disney really taught me a lot about the international tv industry, and the work ethics and brand values they hold are second to none.
Female:100.00%, Male, so yesterday was my first weekend shift. it was from 12pm-11pm, but i didn't show up until 3pm. lol, it had completely slipped my mind. i had woken up around 1pm and made breakfast and stuff. as i got out of the shower, i was like, "holy shit, i was supposed to be at work right now". needless to say, i got dressed and drove to work. i was assigned to a new trainer named lauren. i think she mentioned that she trained katherine, not entirely too sure on that. anyhoo, saturday was a pretty lax day comparatively. i had begun to practice documenting on a notepad and then entering in the computer system. i'm getting the hang of it, but there's still so much to learn about the whole thing. i met a lot of new people on saturday. i guess it was because that's when most people worked, considering they are around my age but a little older. 
Male:91.15%, Female, hippocrates is known for the hippocratic oath that medical doctors are sworn by. hippocrates was the first known physician. his name is also where the word hypocrite originates from. i’m not sure how it correlates with medicine but i’ve come to know plenty of hypocrites. some believe being hypocritical is sometimes in others best interest. me? i disagree. if people ask questions they can’t handle the answer to..why ask? i’m a rather sensitive soul yet i can appreciate brute honesty any day...over simple hypocritical bullshit! don’t keep it real. keep it sincere...your reality may be askew from mine......
Female:100.00%, Female, when i was younger, i loved stuffed animals. i had so many stuffed animals in my room and even more beanie babies. whenever i did get a new stuffed animal, i would always pick one out and then second guess my choice. i would worry about not "saving" the other animals from the store. i vividly remember being in a gift shop of a hotel and picking out a new stuffed animal. there were essentially two different choices. i could get the dog with the brown spots or the dog with the black spots. but it was so much more complicated than that with me. i chose the dog with the brown spots and then i wondered which of the brown-spotted dogs to choose. i closed my eyes quickly picked one up. when i opened my eyes, i looked at all the dogs still on display that i hadn't chosen. i promised myself that when i came back to the hotel, i'd "save" the rest of them. so you can only imagine my struggle in picking out a guinea pig to save at the pet store. the poor little furballs had probably never been touched since they'd arrived at pet co. and they're all in the clear plexi-glass boxes, which are horrible for them to begin with, with crappy bedding (litterally) and such little space to move. thank god we had to get a girl (since mike's sister has a girl guinea pig and we want them to play together without having to worry about little baby guinea pigs), or else the decision would have taken hours. there were four female guinea pigs available at pet co. the day we went in to get our guinea pig. there were two white ones which i quickly eliminated, sadly, completely based on the color of their skin. they had the red eyes and just didn't look like guinea pigs really. i felt so bad for them because they would probably not be adopted for a while.. maybe not ever. just thinking about them now is making me sad. i should have been less appearance-focused and maybe got one of them, but i didn't. it was incredibly hard to decide between the other two. i had liked the one's that fur looked like a calico cat's. mike liked the brown one with the white stripe. the guinea pig would be mine, but i wanted mike to love her too. it was all my decision and i was bringing her into our apartment and he promised he would help financially and with feeding and cleaning her cage. i knew i would love which ever guinea pig we chose. the calico one was especially cute because her nose was even spotted-- half was white and half was black. but the one with the white stripe was a lot more active. we had actually came to pet co. three times in the week and she was always awake and jumping around the cage. the calico one was always asleep. also, mike and i had decided on a name beforehand, pikachu, and the brown one looked more like a "pikachu" to me. so based on her personality, the name we chose and mike's previous opinion that he liked the brown one more, i chose the brown one. 
Female:100.00%, Female, ow do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. so this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn't bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me. but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. so my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? the current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe. i want to know how you would deal with a person you cant quite get rid of... 
Female:100.00%, Male, the honorable mention of the day was a girl who came in complaining about abdominal pains. the killer here is that she said she was mainly having cold symptoms like runny nose and congestion, but nonchalantly mentions the fact that she hasn't pooped in a week. she also said that was normal for her. o_o didn't poop for an entire week! wouldn't you be a little freaked out by that?! i just about lost it. i couldn't get over it...i still can't. i also think i had drank the most coffee in one day than i ever had in my life. it was three cups. it wasn't because i was tired or anything. caffeine has minimal effect of me. the coffee just tasted sooo good. in the physician's lounge, scribes are allowed to go in on the weekends because it's not as busy i guess. anyway, they have coffee machines that have these little one-cup packet thingies that you insert into the machine. i forget the brand name of them, but they taste amazing. that's pretty much i had to say about saturday i guess. it's harder to blog about it the day after, i suppose. anyhoo, until next time. 
Male:100.00%, Male, first group of onions planted... sudarshan suryawanshi - ide india - drip irrigation expert - visited our farm yesterday... sudarshan said we are doing better with the ide drip irrigation systems than the two major agri universities in honduras... we held our first meeting of honduran campesino farmers at our center of operations... we are receiving reports of how there are those who hold top positions as agri directors for major honduran ngo´s... who do not want the ide systems at our farm... hah! you will not stop our work... i have said for years... the help must go directly to the organized honduran campesinos... most of the agricultural ngo´s in hondurans are dinosaur institutions... who only promote sustainable famine projects... 
Female:100.00%, Male, six years later i lay at night and think about love and i have moved on to find happiness cause that's what she would have wanted. there is some one that i do love now, and would give her my heart. i know i'm not handsome or the man that i was 6 yrs ago with my looks. but my heart is big and kind. i would never be mean to her nor make her feel sad or down. i would give her the world and so much happiness if she would be mine. i know she's been hurt and afraid but with me i would protect her and be there every day. i lay awake and count the stars wondering why i've been alone for so long. i would give her my heart cause its who she is that i care so much about. for my heart beats for her. i just wonder if her heart will beat next to mine.
Female:100.00%, Female, well for those that don't know i am taking 10 freshman kids from school to the grand canyon over spring break! yes i have lost my mind.... no i really am excited... i think! we leave early monday morning for the airport to fly to las vegas. then we fly out the red eye friday night! so yes i am spending my spring break with kids what am i thinking? i am sure it will be a vacation i will never forget! 
Female:62.23%, Male, what can you say about a fertility doctor who detonated a twenty-ton hydrogen bomb? quite a bit, actually, and most of it good. juliet is one of the more accomplished characters in the lost universe, male or female, and a lot of what she did doesn’t seem to have any significant connection to her gender, unlike being a love interest (like kate), a mother (like claire), a dedicated wife (like sun), or a bullet-riddled corpse that men can shed tears over (like shannon, ana-lucia and libby). before i get into it, however, i’ll point out to anyone reading this series for the first time that i was inspired to look at how gender works on lost and whether the show’s female characters seem to suffer especially dreadful hardships in comparison to the men. i was motivated to consider this after reading and the a.v. club’s review of the “dr. linus” episode. the article suggested that women on the show do get screwed over, and i’m starting to think that it may be true. here are the previous posts that focused on lost’s ladies, with a quick summary of whether the character in question got put through the ringer:
Male:100.00%, Male, as an undeniable wasp whose north american ancestry goes back to the colonial period, i usually keep my opinions of israel’s behavior to myself. such is my concern for the typical whiplash from many of my fellow citizens who remain ensconced in a sort of israel-right-or-wrong mindset. but in the current israeli issue before the us—israel’s continual building program’s encroachment on palestinian land—while we are sacrificing treasure and lives in the middle east and continue to suffer financial stress at home, i am unable to keep my mouth shut. israel’s recalcitrance mit gewalt, so to speak, is insane. 
Male:97.03%, Male, falling awake between the vastness of time and space burning alive surrounded by boiling skin perpetual nosebleeds pouring blood out the rim mentally wiped out from the world's rat race. lingering in limbo between insomnia and hibernation from this place i need liberation for sleep is where i begin thought cultivation germination of motivation for my imagination. without sleep our minds are more open to be manufactured the elite lulling you into the facade of the rapture the brain stuck inside a cell, captured while our ability to learn the truth has been fractured. but i digress from this stress before creating a mess. if i could i would regress to words previously at my access. but as for now i'll express myself to excess. the living game of chess to which we obsess will diminish your finesse and halt life's progress. yes i transgress, to which i confess with true success. nevertheless, the human race is a damsel in distress held steady by the "freedom" of the press. once this is posted, i'm sure they'll already have my address.
Female:100.00%, Male, i only have to be in a sunny beach side resort for a few days and i start to believe that i understand the local culture, respect the traditions and customs – 8 days into a holiday and i’m looking at property prices, wondering how i can give up the rat race to rent deck chairs out on the nearest beach – oblivious of course to any hidden social, political or environmental considerations that disappear under the protected and surreal atmosphere of sunbathing, swimming, restaurants on the beach, and wearing shorts and open toe sandals. so given this, i am normally very patient with this kind of conversation from ‘newbies’. after meeting your 10,000th person who knows all about the country you live in you adopt a skill i refer to as “hearing without listening”. so i was surprised when something really upset me during the conversation i was having with this particular women. i wont embarrass her or me in releasing her name, but this was the anchor lady from a uk tv news program, a very famous, well educated, well dressed, well travelled, porsche driving (that may give the game away to people who know her) alpha female – the type that would eat you alive, and leave most men in a jelly like state after her whip lashing tongue had finished destroying any male ego you had the audacity to possess. she was like a chinese moon cake (i will explain in a later blog) tempting and attractive on the outside, only to find a strong, spicy, and pungent filling on the inside.
Male:100.00%, Female, i dont know why its taken me so long to realize most people don’t live with principles in their lives? i guess since i was raised to carry myself with some integrity...i figured others did the same. no good deed goes unpunished. this i learned the hard way. humans do not realize they are the very cause of their own demise. in this myriad of complexities we call the matrix or cyber world. people become lost. hiding behind their pc or phone screen. playing dress-up for their webcam or camphone. no real friends or relationships. nothing tangible. me? i like to be able to reach out n touch someone. whether it be to show love or put tips on em. old skool stilo. just know in my life..integrity exists. dignity is honored. principles matter. when i leave gods green earth i can take those with me. the matrix is all an illusion so doesn’t be mislead.
Female:99.94%, Male, i am honored to be here today and to have the opportunity to share this time with you. when judge mordue asked me to speak, i was delighted to accept. this venue combines two of my favorite groups; students and veterans. i am a history teacher at cazenovia high school and truly believe helping and nurturing young scholars to be my reason for being. young people like you are near and dear to my heart. with regard to veterans, i happen to be one, but that is secondary. for me, veterans are the embodiment of our nation’s virtues. they are also living repositories of history. you’re probably tired of hearing your teachers tell you that we need to learn from history, so let me phrase it differently – we can and should learn from those who have made history. each year, i require my students to seek out and learn from veterans of our nation’s wars. how blessed you are to have veterans in your own family – i hope you will never stop learning from them. 
Female:99.76%, Male, a word to the wise, if your look in for love and havint found it, the only advice i can give you lady’s and guys is maybe you are look in all the wrong places. maybe you need to just set back and enjoy life and they well come find you. trust me i have looked and looked and about the time i was about to give up and just set back and live life to the fullest she found me, i could be wrong but hey what’s life you can't have someone to enjoy it with right. keep your heads up and you well find that speacle someone!!!!
Female:99.97%, Female, it started raining friday morning. and it rained. and then it rained. and then it really rained. in the wee early hours of saturday morning the wind became frenzied. an endless whistle punctuated by roaring gusts. the kind of wind that either mutes all other sounds or distorts them into something ominous. is that the trees moving? or is there an army of ninjas crawling on the roof? our backyard and the suburban crap sprawl beyond it inclines toward the house. not the smartest groundbreaking move but it’s really fine as long as you have a french drain around the foundation. we do not have a french drain. we do however have a lovely lakeside view. 
Female:100.00%, Male, it's 2010, a whole new year full of possibilities has begun. for so many people, it's seen as a clean slate to mark a starting point. for others, a desperate hope for a terminus of a crap-filled past. for the rest, it's just a date on the calendar that reminds them to do something trivial yet important, like changing the batteries in their smoke detectors. for me, i suppose it's all three. first, i find the old soldiers, scattered around but within reach. in the glove box, in the travel case, in the overnight bag, in the dresser. it was time to say goodbye to my old pals, sad they couldn't see any action on the front lines, rotated out, having served their vigilant duty. it was time to bring in the new recruits. then off to the local recruitment office (aka abu's gas-n-sip) to find the replacements. i stood there surveying the troops at abu's. twisted pleasure, her pleasure, shared pleasure, intense ribbed... they've all had their time on the front lines. magnum xl? i knew there was a magnum, but an xl??? damn, i feel sorry for that guy. i finally settle on the 3-pack "ultra thin" variety. good, i could never feel anything with these before, maybe this version will make me feel like i'm actually a part of the process for once. only a 3-pack because i've thrown more away for being too old and unreliable than i've made use of in my life. plus, i was a bit jaded after tossing out 2 unopened family packs the day before. which really brings up the question: big boxes of twelve are called "family packs". isn't that a bit counter-intuitive, considering their intended function? maybe that's what my subconscious was thinking at the time i bought the last few boxes. if i get a family pack, i can make a family. huh. so anyway, i got the ultra-thin... not because it was ultra-thin (although that might be a bonus) but because it was the box with the furthest-off expiration date: 06-2014. maybe if the stars align just right, this box will be opened before then. oh, i bought a mega-millions lottery ticket too while i was at the gas-n-sip. i figured i'd have better chances with that than with my other purchase. come on, 32!!! win for me, sweetheart! 
Female:99.53%, Male, life sucks! i hate it. not even a new camera makes it any better. i know now that my whole life has been a fucking waste. i have accomplished nothing. i'm an unemployed looser that has made nothing for himself. life is nothing more than a cruel joke. hiv sure is taking it's sweet time with me and i don't expect the fucking heart attack to kick in fast enough. only death will be the cure for this incurable infection. i am sure i lost a lot of friends over this and well, sorry to say but i honestly don't care. for most of you i'm just another coin in your collection and not one of the more valuable ones either. if you want to delete me, you go right ahead. the last fucking thing i need right now is someone telling me i got so much to fucking live for. i'm sorry but you don't know me that well, i would actually prefer that you did delete me if this blog is too much of a downer for you. there's nothing left to say....... 
Female:93.63%, Male, every day or so i shall give insight upon what i brandon rogers am thinking. i will not as most state what i am doing or feeling but the thoughts and stories of my mind. all things may not be as they seem. i may stray from the truth and bring out my most creative muse to entertain you. if this however comes to be please be aware that i will eventually tell you.one hand shake is a simple greating. two is still okay if they are at the begining and end of a meeting of some sort. three is awkward but aceptable. my only issue is when people are so nervus that they keep shakeing your hand throught out the meeting or what not. i have no problem with shakeing someones hand but i have noticed something odd. most of my friends are female and most of there boy friends when they meet me they get nervous and so on to actualy shaking hands seven or eight times with me. are they looking for my approval? are they treating me like there only chance to get layed? just an odd thing in life that i noticed. ohh well. 
Female:100.00%, Female, i'm sitting at my computer on this chilly autumn morning with a gentle breeze floating through my very open window. i can see tall trees and a families backyard and i hear men's voices as they walk around preparing to demolish the house located just behind mine. i hear trucks, cars and buses on the road, the occasional horn and birds singing their cares away and chattering among themselves. today i'm more expressing a thought then a questions, will the world really change so severely in the next couple of years that if i were doing this in ten years i wouldn't hear the noises or see the trees? well i know that by next week i wont see the trees, the block of land they are located on is being flattened so that contractors can build housing commission flats on it. the whether has gotten a lot chillier since autumn began a few weeks ago, i wrap a blanket around myself every time i leave my bed in the morning. i like the mornings that i look back at my bed after leaving it and i see my partner still laying there sleeping peacefully with his head now laying on the very same pillow mine just left. its lonely mornings like this one that i dislike. on days like this i wonder about my future, will i achieve all the goals i want to achieve, will i help, will i still be with him? then i casually shake my head and forget about them, its no use worrying over what is going to happen in a few years when you don't even know what might be happening that very day.... 
Female:91.31%, Male, 1. avoid them, or 2. do the harder thing (which, in my opinion is always the best), and empathize with them and their issue. you can't change anyone, but i think if you empathize, that builds trust, and you could possibly have the opportunity to offer some steps to correct the looping path away from the issue. i'm not a professional counselor (i'm think you might not be either), but caring for someone and their issue can open up your heart and mind to offer caring advice from time to time. love and empathy can help you help others. all this is hard. life itself is hard, but sometimes the hardest lessons are the most rewarding. practice empathy. do your best to set aside the instant platitude, listen and be empathetic. the world is full of people going through difficult times, and if you take some times to start to practice empathy, you could have the opportunity to release the pain of one person, and that could have a positive ripple effect. i'll leave you with this. this has happened to me. sometimes the people that you help with empathy, can turn around and help you in a future time. we are not on this planet to be on our own, we need each other. have a great week. another little distraction coming next monday. tell a friend. :) 
Male:53.63%, Male, every piece of advice a father can impart on his son can make all the difference in the world. sometimes it doesn’t even involve words… my father came from a family where the word “love” was scarcely shared. my dad was never the one for words. he always worked long hours or terrible shifts as a coal miner in west virginia when i was young. when the coal mines shutdown, we moved to florida where the cost of living was higher and the wages lower. my dad worked…that’s what he did. 
Female:99.16%, Female, i am getting increasingly irritated by the minute. i wish people around me could get over their own inconsequential lives and stop bringing their negativity into the lives of others. i am beyond the point where i can offer empty consolation and sugar-coated words just to seem 'nice'. i am tired of people who sulk around all day thinking about their own humongous huge issues and 'problems' and spoil life for every body. just suck it in and continue to do what you have to do; that is where the strength lies, not in pretending defiance at the mere hint of another trying to make light the situation, which they probably are doing to make you feel better and realize how infinitesimal and pointless your gargantuan 'issues' are.
Male:100.00%, Male, in his book in search of the ivory-billed woodpecker, jerome a. jackson relates that a fossil species was described as campephilus dalquesti by pierce brodkorb, an american ornithologist and paleontologist. this fossil species was discovered in scurry county in central texas, and dated to the late pliocene epoch. i wonder what c. dalquesti looked like. maybe a bit like this dino-bird!? at least the colors look right. the dino-bird portrayed below is anchiornis huxleyi - you can find more info here. check out this amazing video on finding dino color in fossil feathers. 
Female:100.00%, Female, the weather's turned, and the old neighbors creep out from their crammed rooms to blink in the sun, as if surprised to find they've lived through another winter. though steam heat's left them pale and shrunken like old root vegetables, mr. and mrs. tozzi are already hard at work on their front-yard mini-sicily: a virgin mary birdbath, a thicket of roses, and the only outdoor aloes in manhattan. it's the old immigrant story, the beautiful babies grown up into foreigners. nothing's turned out the way they planned as sweethearts in the sinks of palermo. still, each waves a dirt-caked hand in geriatric fellowship with stanley, the former tattoo king of the merchant marine, turning the corner with his shaggy collie, who's hardly three but trots arthritically in sympathy. it's only the young who ask if life's worth living, notmrs. sansanowitz, who for the last hour has been inching her way down the sidewalk, lifting and placing her new aluminum walker as carefully as a spider testing its web. on days like these, i stand for a long time under the wild gnarled root of the ancient wisteria, dry twigs that in a week will manage a feeble shower of purple blossom, and i believe it: this is all there is, all history's brought us here to our only life to find, if anywhere, our hanging gardens and our street of gold: cracked stoops, geraniums, fire escapes, these old stragglers basking in their bit of sun. 
Female:100.00%, Female, wow...has three years already passed?? neither of us can believe it. it seems like yesterday that we just met. it's unimaginable the love we share. regardless of our past and present we look on to the future as a family. i admit, we didn't know each other for too long until we just clicked. we saw each other's pain and mended it. we are each other's missing piece in the most uncomprehensible jigsaw puzzle fitting right into place. we've had our fights, but we learn from them and grow stronger. we have our special moments and grow stronger. we discuss everything and hide nothing and grow stronger. everyone tells him how lucky he is to have me at his side, but yet they don't understand that i am incredibly lucky to have him at my side. alex is the type of guy that every guy wishes they could be and that every girl would want. sure he has his downfalls, but if you don't accept them and help your love up, that is your downfall. we have shared our past to each other and our ex's, but together we laugh and say how far we've come to finally meet the right person to wake up to and enjoy life with. there is no better way to grow but through experience and communication with no restraints. no lies, no hidden messages. just straight forward truth and compassion. we are always supportive of each other through whatever endeavor. if we disagree, we discuss; and from that we understand each others points and come to conclusion. i'm not materialistic like his past relations and that's what he loves. i keep him happy as any woman should to his man. we are our own person and there is no better way to be expressed. i'm quite a goofy one so it always makes him smile. seeing him smile is such a joy it makes me smile. now we have sasha as well and she just helps us grow even more closer. his mother and i adore each other and confide in each other so dearly. we are the best of friends. our small family may be small, but in our hearts we are as big and robust as the night time sky if not more. three years have just gone by so fast.....we all await for what the future holds for us as our love grows stronger.
Female:84.69%, Male, he cannot speak english, and makes no bones about it. can we talk in hindi?, he asks coolly as we settle down with meethi chai in an air-conditioned hostel room, which he shares with fellow boxers vijay and ram singh at patiala’s national sports institute. why stay in a hostel, now? “as a child i shared a room with my brother and five cousins. we were seven in a tiny room, and now we are just three!” uncluttered and uncomplicated. maybe, that’s what makes him a darling of the press. or is it his rakish, rugged charm? “don’t know. people say i am more popular than abhinav bindra. it’s destiny that i was born into a humble bus driver’s family. had i been pampered with trainers and dieticians, i wouldn’t be what i am today. i am an athlete of the soil, fed on a solid diet of bajre ki roti and bhains ka doodh . “ vijender’s roots are rock solid. his father still works for haryana roadways as a bus driver. “i’ve told him to take it easy, now that we have the money. but he says the day he stops working he’ll stop living. i remember when my father used to farm a small piece of land. i helped him by watering the crops. those were memorable days. tilling the soil with bare hands is joy in its purest form. i think that’s why farmers have a quiet dignity about them. “ this boy from a nondescript up village called kaluwas, along the meham-bhiwani road, hadn’t seen much of life or money till destiny catapulted him to overnight stardom. today, his days are full. he jet-sets to delhi and mumbai every week for photo ops, endorsement deals and p3 parties, where he rubs shoulders with bollywood stars and society babes. this six-feet-tall charmer has also walked the ramp for rohit bal. 
Female:100.00%, Female, after college and getting settled in a new job i decided that it was time for a new chapter in life. so i moved into my very own place. yes 23 and just moving out. i knew this would be a very difficult move because i had never even stayed overnight away from home but maybe 3 times. boy was i right! so i called in for reinforcements. jodi and kristy to save the day. we all needed to get away for our own reasons so this was the perfect time. we would watch tom cruise movies and eat popcorn until we got sick. painting the house was a damn good time considering that none of us was 100% sure of what was going on. thank god for family. who knows what that place would have looked like. after the newest wore off and everybody got into something else, there i was all alone again. i still had family but i needed someone. so i had lost some weight and was feeling pretty good about myself so i called up jodi and told her we needed to get together. she had been through a divorce recently so she was ready.
Female:99.21%, Female, i do not seem to be able to stay current with anything lately and blogging has been the worst. i am trying to keep up with assignments in my web design class, keep my lia sophia business afloat, which means calls and organization and keeping up with paper work, trying to keep my house clean and attempting to get some long overdue redecorating done. which brings me to this picture? remember when my son moved home for 6 months and we repainted his room in the color of his choice? well this room is now my office (with another cardboard creation homework assignment from sadie's art teacher stored here). it is bright! not in a good way. 
Female:85.32%, Female, i don't want to admit how long it took me to figure out what these are called. as soon as i figured it out i said, "duh, i knew that." sea urchins, or echinoids (dead), in case you were wondering. i'm glad i saved some poor soul the time searching on google for "round, hollow sea creature", or "spherical sea creature" or "circular coral reef animal", because i certainly did not spend a lot of time doing the same thing, nope, not me. and now that i am done wasting time on the internet looking up round sea animals i will now go waste more time on the internet stalking people on facebook. this has been a public service announcement brought to you by a procrastinating graduate student that just wants to go home right now. have a nice day :) 
Female:99.91%, Male, my name is ryan. i like snowboarding, hiking, hunting, fishing... well anything that is outdoors. i am pretty straight forward. if i am thinking something i am going to tell you. i joined the military back in march and currently doing job training for the next year. i love what my job is in the military. thats all i can say about that. if there is anything else you want to know about me just ask. who i'd like to meet: i have all the people in my life now that i want. i just wish i could be closer to all of them. 
Female:100.00%, Female, then there was my life, which had fallen apart. all i was left with was the thought that i has tried, really tried and nothing in my life worked and my psychic pain was worse. god, i thought was either ignoring me or he just did not think i had prayed the right prayers, thought the right thoughts, gone to church enough, repented enough, suffered enough, believed enough, done enough, or was just not good enough. and i was very, very angry at him. after awhile i gave up and recently decided that i would try to fix me, to save me myself. then i gave up on god again. and it has been wonderful. my therapist is helping me find hope in, to accept, to connect with, to believe in, myself. i have reached points where i just want to crawl out of my hole and join a wonderful world. when i have those moments where i can't take 'it,' where my childhood demons overwhelm me and i want to get away, i retreat into my room, but i don't want to crawl in a hole anymore. i am open to the ideal that there is indeed something 'else.' something nurturing, kind, loving, in this universe but i am looking for that within myself. 
Female:100.00%, Male, i truly miss "love". young love was a beautiful thing. it was the most comforting thing i have ever felt. i was never the relationship type of guy. i didn't even romantically or sexually care for females. but, after experiencing so-called, "love". i don't want to be without it. i do wish, that i had found love with someone smarter. someone who had a brighter thought pattern. and what upsets me the most is that i had worked hard. but, it all went to waste. and now, i have to rebuild it with someone new someday. i have no patience for that. i just want to skip to a time when i have it next. i don't want some gross ass bitch. i don't want some dumbass slutty-type little girl. i want a beautiful, intelligent, mellow, logical, selfless, understanding, ladie-like female. someone who doesn't involve herself with a grimey crowed. and does not use drugs or alcohol. someone, i can respect. who stays covered up. and makes logical decisions and considers most to all factors in a situation. someone who can appreciate all things and keep me happy as well as me keep her happy. i am afraid that i will never find that. i hate that i want to find love again. but, the truth is, love is a wonderful thing. i don't know what else to say. i'm sure that 'god' has someone in mind for me. and has had someone in mind for me in a while. the only problem i have is that i have become very impatient and depressed. time has become my enemy. and that is causing me issues. i have writer's block. goodbye for now. 
Female:100.00%, Female, she loves to wear dresses while she plays trains and cars. she tromps through the mud in her pink tights. rarely leaves the house without a necklace or bracelet, but runs faster than the boys and hasn't met a jungle gym she can't conquer, even at 2 3/4. the day i snapped this shot with my phone, we spent quite a bit of time shoe shopping, just for fun. she loves red heels, just like i do. (i would have bought these, but they were too big for both of us.) we giggled and pranced in the isles of ross, trying on silly shoes we didn't need just because it was fun and they were really inexpensive, anyway. i am so proud of my little girl. she is her grandma judeen's granddaughter. i have no doubt that she, too, will be bailing hay in a miniskirt or stomping across the cow pasture without looking down, perfectly accessorized. 
Female:91.54%, Male, i was at the public library last friday. i was working on a sermon. in a carrel across from me was a man with his back to me. i first noticed him because he was a loud typer. every keystroke echoed through the library. i couldn't have been the only to notice. i tried my best to keep my mind on what i was doing but every once in a while his fingers would whirl across the keyboard and the noise would echo out. so, i would look over at him and then i noticed; he was surfing myspace sites that had gay men in provocative poses and they were unclothed. to each his own. but, please, don't use a public computer for that! i suspect he was using the library computer because there would be no record of where he was or what he was looking at. had he been surfing those sites at work he likely would have been looking at some disciplinary action. but, i didn't need to see that. please don't use a public computer for that
Female:100.00%, Female, i get so emotional and then i laugh, we humans are really something. i can enjoy reading debates on subjects that i have no opinion about but when it comes to subjects where i have choosen a point of view that is very deep in my heart i shun away and i can't continue reading. i do not want to comment. right now people are fighting for the right to home school in sweden, as some religious family made some bad choices based on their beliefs. there is an article about how children learn(link below) that i agree with. i wish i had the chance to live like this when i was young. i sometimes do not understand my own children´s choices to attend school and all the things (restrictions) that goes with that. freedom for me is so important but i will respect my children´s choices now as well as when they grow up. although every now and then (too often, elena says) i ask if she wants to quit school and i reminded her how nice it was before school. fyi elena started school when she was 9, and i am happy she waited that long at least. anyway i am getting lots of emails from the swedish homeschooling group about articles and ofcourse there is lots of comments on the subject. some are so uphauling that it is just amazing to me how we as humans can have such extreme opposite beliefs. but that is really okay. what turns my stomach is how people can judge and condemn others for their beliefs. well, i was just in the middle of it today and did not feel so good. i know it can be lonely to be a warrior (my favorite definition, from stuart wild, i mean different from mass consciousness) but it sure is worth it. 
Female:100.00%, Female, the world is full of some beautiful souls, and it surely seems that olivier dupon from dossier37 is one of them. he is known to many sydneysiders for his gorgeous shop lola et moi, which he ran for about three years, and now the rest of the world is getting to know his quirky, colourful and inspired ways through his blog dossier37. olivier kindly shared these pics with daily imprint of his home in pyrmont. as he describes it, "great views, great light... we use the flat as a white blank canvas for our collections of antique and modern artworks and designer pieces."
Female:99.84%, Female, born in brooklyn and now living in the not so wide open spaces of nj. i have a 35 year old son - yes i was a knocked up teen - he and his wife share a mother/daughter type home with me. i run my own business - used to have an office but now work out of home. i often work a second job to pay for internet service. i have 2 rescued cats.
Female:100.00%, Female, i have become just a little bit wrapped up in this weight loss process and all the new things i am discovering about me, my habits around food, alternative forms of exercise, and life in general. i have shared all of my thoughts with you on this blog but i really don’t want this blog to be a weight loss blog. i started living the life of tere to be about my life, my family, my thoughts. me, me, me. weight loss is a part of my life but it is not the only part of me. but i had things i wanted to share with others about weight loss, things that have helped friends and others. i started to put off writing here about some funny things my kids did and other stories so i could post some weight loss stories. that’s not really where i wanted things to go. i decided i needed to compartmentalize my life a bit when it comes to sharing my life with others. so i did something that makes no sense with the small amount of time i have . . . i started a separate weight loss blog. one where i can share my thoughts on weight loss, food diary, successes and failures, low calorie recipes, tips and tricks from others, reviews of products, other people’s success stories . . . for those that are interested in that type of thing. 
Female:100.00%, Female, we were friends along the way, sharing postcards, phone calls, fudge, pasta developed for diabetics, and videos of bill the dog. we figured out ways to get along regardless of our differences. you were part of my life for over two years and now you are gone. no more "yer" this and "yer" that. no more emails outside of myspace, that most others knew nothing about. i always appreciated your consideration for my feelings. when we first met, sometime in 2007 or 2008, you didn't think you would live until christmas of that year. but you did. count that as extra gravy. but i know it hasn't been easy extra time. with all my heart, i hope you just went to sleep the other night and never woke up. sleep well with peaceful dreams, sweetpea. we won't forget you. 
Male:99.87%, Male, impurity is the only thing that is pure. the greater, richer and so called pure things are always vulnerable to impurity. but impurity in itself is the truest of the forms. look at the world. the corrupt hearts are so strong. least shaken and unchanged. so mighty powerful that the world used to be a better place once with only a handful of corrupt hearts. but those handful ones had the mighty power of impurity. they spread it like the plague. look around you. what yo ve is the invincible disease. so much so that the god's heart is touched by it and its a never failing touch. 
Female:95.60%, Female, where i come from it’s…. a small island of the coast of north carolina called “cape hatteras island,” known for the tallest lighthouse in our nation. it’s also known for its beaches, white sands, surfing waves, and it’s treacherous diamond shoals. it has a very rich, full history in many areas of our past; wars, pirates, and tourism. many stories fill my head and my heart over flows with the memories i myself have on that little sandy beach i called home for most of my life. my family moved to cape hatteras when i was a very young girl, i believe i began the 3rd grade there on the island. we moved across the states from bremerton washington with my father’s job in the us navy. of course moving to the island at that time brought great change in my life and back then it truly was just a little island, full of mom and pop shops and restaurants, little tourism, and 1 full military base. as a child our days were spent; playing with the neighboring children, playing in the park, or making a trip over the dunes to play at the beach. in many ways it was ideal yet in today’s society by many standards it would be considered lacking on so many levels. 
Female:98.90%, Female, the other day i was so lucky as to be able to spend time at one of my favorite places. it's a place i hope to spend the vast majority of my summer. (second to work, i suppose, but let's not think about that now) shortly after arriving, i ran into a friend and inquired as to his well being. he replied, "oh, perfect! if i won the lottery, it'd be a step down!" i love it. i feel the same way, surrounded by such awesome people in my life. 
Female:100.00%, Female, hospital waiting rooms have wi-fi now. isn't that great? and it's noisy in here. i didn't expect that. we are swapping stories about my mil who has not been married to my fil for years. mil travels with food. half-eaten food. want some coffee cake? i couldn't leave it behind, it was so good. that kind of thing. my sil is here in dayton from madison, wi. other sil, from chicago, will come in later this week, tag team hospital visits. the plan, medico-wise, is to remove a goodly portion of fils left lung, and follow up with chemotherapy. because he actually has a chance to survive this thing, fil has quit smoking. so far, anyway. his wife is working on it. sil from madison will be taking regular smoke-breaks during the day. we are working on our explorations of the kitchen-infested, extended-stay hotels in the south dayton area. last night's was not as nice as the last one we stayed in, but it was fifty bucks cheaper for the night. so there's that. and i am never one to pass up a free breakfast. the back pain is subsiding, which is good. i am being very careful with it, to maintain. thanks to everyone for all your good wishes, both for me and for husband's dad. if the waiting gets long or boring, i'll hop on and write some more, and i'll post any updates we hear. for now i'll post because i am a total comment whore. shut up. no wait. don't shut up. i mean shut up about me being a comment whore. i think i've had too much coffee this morning. 
Male:100.00%, Male, so when it comes to war, i'm not sure how to define my stance. overall, i'm a pacifist and think war is always wrong. new rule: mankind never gets to say it is divinely created, enlightened or intelligent while blowing the shit of another country. but... i know fighting can be inevitable. even the tao te ching refers to defending oneself and, let me tell you, i embrace this philosophy as wholeheartedly as i do my pacifism. you take a swing at me buster, you best prepare for some knuckle sammies. not very christ-like i suppose but a) i'm not a christian and b) modern christians rarely follow this admonition anyway. now, some will argue that war and defending oneself is much the same thing. they see war as a good thing, a thing to be practiced often. peace is not an option; only killing and bloodshed. they revel in this power. these sorts of humans brag of "military might" and having "the best trained, finest army in the world" just as napoleon did or caesar before him. they lust for fighting and dominance, dominance over the whole earth. does it truly make a difference if these mad men are americans and not germans? since when is killing and destruction a virtue to anyone but the fabled denizens of hell itself? war is a poisonous goo filling their hearts and thoughts with taking a hill or planning bombing raids never mind the collateral damage. that's what i just don't get or put my head around. how can one delight in the slaughter of war? but it is so. i see it daily. there are millions of my fellow americans who see war as glorious and divinely sanctioned and are proud to send our soldiers into death, cheering along like roman cheering gladiators into the colloseum arena. war is not sport but it has been transformed into one in these modern times where we can watch the participants play on youtube or cnn. it's like a live action video game except when our soldiers die they don't get to hit the reset button and try the level again. 
Female:100.00%, Female, how do you deal with grief? i found myself crying last night as i watched a tv show and one of the main characters painfully re-entered the same location where her daughter was suddenly taken from her. it reminded me of the night my puppy chucky was taken. now i know an animal can't really be compared to a human loss but my little puppy was my angel, my shadow and my baby. i still grieve over the loss and i still see the accident in my head on a regular basis. so this wont get me any fans but i am a self proclaimed high school bully, i am not ashamed of it because it is how i survived high school. i didn't bully every one i just picked on certain people and most of the time it was retaliation for shit they had already done to me. but since school has finished i left my bullying days behind me, i left every one alone. so my question tonight is how do you deal with people who you cant really get rid of? the current pain in my ass happens to be my boyfriends best friends partner so i cant really stomp on her and then scrape her off the bottom of my shoe.
Female:100.00%, Female, there are many things in life that make me happy. little things, things that just make me smile. one of my favorites is post secret sundays. post secret is a project started a few years ago by a man named frank. frank left a few postcards in a few public places with simple instructions. write a secret on it, decorate it if you like, and send it in, anonymously, to the address already written on the card. it grew into quite a phenomena. now, frank gets postcards from all over the world. he's compiled them and published more than one book. and every sunday, frank posts a new set of secrets on postsecret.com. even with the books and the website, only a fraction of the secrets are viewed. every sunday, i log on to my computer, excited to see the new secrets. it's a simple pleasure that i truly enjoy. the secrets are often sad, sometimes disturbing, occasionally funny, but always insightful. everyone has secrets. little secrets, like you really don't like your friend's new haircut. unimportant secrets, like it was you who ate all the blueberries(an actual secret that made me laugh out loud). and big, important secrets, ones you don't even dare think about for fear of inexplicably blurting out loud simply from the weight of it.
Female:100.00%, Female, woke up around 11 am and realised that i most likely was dying. the horror...! the horror...! it should be said that i deal with illness like a man, an over-dramatic man. so i phoned my doctor, seeing as i'm stockholm-bound for friday and didn't feel like suffering from intense ear-ache on my flight. managed to eat an apple. one apple a day does not keep the doctor away. walking to the doctors it was hard not to feel giddy though (in spite of my case of the death). it was so sunny and warm, flowers everywhere and i could really feel how this was it. winter is well and truly over! bumped in to my friend nat, out for some fresh air with a friend. nat was equally ill, and her friend had tonsillitis. poor us. walking back home from the doctors i spotted this book in the childrens bookshop in bruntsfield. i had to stop and buy it for my own (not so) hugless douglas. you can see part of his hairy leg in the picture above. the likeness with a fussy bear is striking. my new bedding was delivered! ooooh, all white, crisp and new! sat on it with doris the ukulele for a while, feeling all summery and happy.
Female:100.00%, Female, that one day, the world will change, and people will start realizing how beautiful life really is. i pray that one day the world will be rid of liars, cheaters, and thieves. &if not rid of, than those people will see that their actions actually do affect others. i pray that their eyes will be opened, and they will start to feel the way that god feels toward his children. i pray for the rid of ignorance and foolishness. i pray for the rid of selfishness. i pray that god's hands will protect the hearts of the ones who live for him, and pity those who never believed. i pray that god will bless those in need of strength and courage. i pray no punishment. but i do pray for the people who need to get what they deserve. i pray that people who don't care, will start to. and people who do care get what they need out of everything. life isn't about wanting things for yourself. it's about loving those who you easily provide for. materials are nothing without the feeling of loving what you have. the thankful feeling you receive when blessed by things that you love. i pray that anger will be lifted off of my shoulders. i pray that god will give me the strength to lift my head up and walk with positive energy. i pray that god will give me the strength to forgive those who i feel i cannot forgive, and help those to forgive me for the wrongs i've caused upon them. &i pray, that one day god will help me believe that this is all worth it, and happiness is really obtainable. 
Female:100.00%, Female, today was one of those i should really get up and do something, but i don't wanna kind of days! so i didn't! i hung out with my wonderful husband and sweet kids. poor hunter came home from his sleepover really sick. as soon as he walked in our front door i knew he was sick! then i felt him and i he said "mom, i feel terrible." he broke my heart. he is running a fever and has a bad cough. if i don't see an improvement in him by tomorrow, i'm going to take him to the er. hunter is so thin and frail as it is because he isn't the best eater, so we kind of panic when he gets sick at all. anyway, other then hunter being sick, our weekend is lazy and good! i like it when mark is off work and the kids are home from school and we can all just be together. our weekdays are so crazy and busy, so the weekends are a time to be together. everyone is gathered around the t.v. right now watching america's most wanted. okay, i know not the best family show, but we all love cops and america's most wanted and we never miss it on saturday night. 
Female:100.00%, Female, alex is now 3.5 months old and doing great. he has found his hands and they are normally in his mouth. he is great at assisted standing and sitting. he has all kinds of sounds. goo, hoo, oooh and ahhh. bouncing in the bath is his favorite activity. his friends elliott (zoe's brother) and maude (max's sister) were born at the end of november. so they are only a couple of months be hind him. max had his second birthday right after christmas. we got to see him open on present. nathan helped with the rest. alex loves to be held when awake. as soon as he is sleeping he wants to be put down in a quiet place. as far as sleep he does ok. currently he is sleeping from 9pm-1am and then up again at 4 and 6 or 7. this would be fine with me but nathan has been getting up at 3. make for a long morning.
Female:100.00%, Female, ok so you know how when you to anywhere they want to know what you're allergic to? well my answer was always nothing. but now i have an answer. anything in the factive family. it took two trips to the hospital and alot of itching to figure it out. i have a few pictures in the "people you know abulm" for you to see but man it's a you had to of been there kind of thing. but with the great nurse i have helping me with my oatmeal baths and slathering down of the old sticky lotion i'll make it through just fine. man you got to love a good nurse! 2-9-08 you know i'm still not sure that i was having a reaction. i have had sooo many kids with the same rash at school. poor kids! 
Male:99.53%, Male, so i'm in the corner tavern the other day, listening to these two enlightened, albeit, not very educated, idiots debating the need for a national health-care program. why is it that every booze hound is an expert on political issues? i go to the bar to drink, not talk, and certainly not to debate current affairs!!! i think from now on, i'll just stay home and drink in the privacy of my own home. i really hate people, especially idiots and morons.......and pretty much everyone else!!!!!!!!!!! assholes!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Female:100.00%, Male, i’m still writing with my lucky pen. it’s been broken in half for a long time now but the ink still makes words. the words sometimes cheer or bring despair; sometimes the rant gets caught in my facial hair. there're holes in my boots and there's holes in my life but that just lets out the shit. i’ve yet to see a wise man stand in my shoes, and see the light of day from my point of view, but perhaps i’m just not wise or i’ve soap in my eyes. i try to keep away from the things i despise but they just follow my feet like i was so much fresh shit and they’re so many flies.
Female:100.00%, Male, hello, nikonsniper followers. well, my trip to the los angeles area is coming to a conclusion. that's right, dear ... i'm coming home! one of the things i do for comfort when i am alone and away from my family for great lengths of time is to listen to sermons online. i know, i can almost hear you shouting "boring"! ok, ok, some of you are about to quit nikonsniper for good! you've heard enough. i have just proved to you that i am completely looney! well, some of you know i was a bit of a creative kid. i was a.d.d. before being a.d.d. was cool! so i was, ... let's say, a bit of a handfull. for those of you who are new, here's a little background to give you an idea of what kind of rodeo clown i was when i was a kid. anyway, i tell you this so you don't go around thinking i have my head in the clouds with no clue of the real world. anyway. i was raised in a christian home. more than that, ... my father was the pastor of a large church that we attended (sometimes in handcuffs). oh, please don't cast me as some kind of religious fanatic. in fact, truth is ... i don't believe in religion whatsoever. i believe in a person and yes i know him. and that god-man is jesus. anyway, ... i don't want to scare you off ... because i do completely respect your views. here's what i wanted to say. i find that as i age (get more older and more wrinkled-er) i appreciate nature more. if you would have told me when i was 30 that i would enjoy photographing butterflies one day ... well, i woulda told you that you were a complete ding-dong (probably not those words though). i so often feel at peace when i am sitting on a bench watching god's wonders. like seeing wild deer up close just staring at you, giving you a close look, like they were sent to you. well, i recently watched a sermon about the christian in nature that i enjoyed called, "is god green?" you can hit the link and watch it if you like. it's good! it is by one of my favorite speakers named john ortberg from menlo park presbyterian church in menlo park, ca. he won't bore you! go on, give it a listen ... i dare ya ... it's a risk free way to tell your mom that you went to church. pastor ortberg speaks on how we are to respect the world of the creator.
Female:100.00%, Female, i love the biggest loser and believe it can truly motivate people to get help when they can’t figure out how to help themselves but the contestants get bigger and their stories sadder each season. all fat people are not sad. some of us have dated and been loved and really like ourselves but want to live healthy, active lives so we change our bad habits and work hard to get rid of the weight we so blindly allowed to take over. but people need to realize that being skinny is a lot like winning the lottery. it’s great and some things are easier but all your emotional issues are still there until you do something about them. maybe self-confidence really was my problem. i was ok, my life was ok. i was happy. so i never did anything about the weight that kept creeping on. i have done something about it several times over the last few years but really only half-heartedly, because i felt like i should. but i am doing it this time and i am very serious about it. 
Male:100.00%, Female, i just love and cherish the place where i was born because i am a friend, cousin, niece and granddaughter of people who reside in israel. i also happen to love the scenery, food, and environment of my homeland. fine, so i lied a bit. i would hate to see israel non-existent or unrecognized. which definitely means i am not anti-israel. i'm also pro-peace. glad we got that out of the way... a little history on how i got into this whole pro-israel mess: i was born in rishon le-tzion, israel. i lived there until i was eight, except for a brief year when my parents decided to venture off to hong kong and get all these stamps on my passport from all of eastern asia. too bad all i have is the passport... i moved to the silicon valley where i only started to value and recognize my israeli identity in high school. i got really involved in a youth group called tzofim, and dreamed of joining the israel defense forces after high school as early as freshman year. i spent every summer vacation in israel during my high school years. summers were all i looked forward to. did i mention the silicon valley has a huge israeli community? well this was a huge factor for my ability to stay connected to my culture instead of diving into the big melting pot of american society. well as it turns out, there aren't many israelis in san diego, where i go to school. thus, when looking to get involved with the israeli community at ucsd, i was right away pointed to the direction of israel advocacy. this is where this whole pro/anti thing comes in. israel advocacy is basically feeding everyone and their mom the greatness of israel through it's diversity, innovations, and did i mention- it is the only democracy in the middle east? it's making sure jews are pro-israel and non-jews are simply not anti. sometimes, i feel as if it one big brainwash. but i live for it. so. i'm going to israel this summer simply to enjoy every beautiful (and humid) moment. 
Female:99.56%, Male, today i shot two portraits. both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. i just couldn't get them to go right, i was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and i am left with a handful of "missing it" photos and none that really get the job done. i have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today i feel a bit like a hypocrite. i shot this photo of the cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. i didn't really pose her, just told her to freeze while i grabbed my camera. there is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can't extract in other situations. what worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn't be replicated even with exponentially more time today. weird.
Female:100.00%, Female, i am at the beach on spring break. not my spring break but my daughter's. several months ago, daughter and her friends decided they were going to the beach for spring break. they planned, they analyzed, they researched then realized that they needed someone older to rent a place and it was going to take a lot more money than they thought. so they invited the moms. don't get me wrong . . . i don't feel used. how many 20 year olds would even consider taking their moms along with them on spring break? we are actually quite honored. and we are having fun. 
Female:97.61%, Female, what if you could have forty million dollars completely tax free... but you could never spend more than two days in the same city. this means that you'd have to move all your stuff every two days. you could rotate cities, but you'd have to put three cities in between every rotation. so if you wanted to go back to whatever city you're from you would have to make sure you stayed six days at three other cities before going back. would you take the money and resign yourself to the life of a nomad or would you stay put and live where you wanted for however long you wanted? i don't know what i’d do. if i took the money i’d definitely invest in an rv. i don't know if i could do that forever though. not having to work ever would be nice, but i may want to stay somewhere sometimes. what would you do? 
Female:100.00%, Female, i am a sucker for a liberty print. i still have several items, including a paisley bag, which i bought from the store when i used to live in london. so it's no surprise that i like these pretty - in a old-fashioned yet contemporary way - baby clothes from elki. it was started by sisters emma and georgina who grew up in a creative home. emma went on to study visual communication and become a graphic designer while georgina studied fashion. emma lives in central west nsw while georgie is based in bowral. the sisters import the fabric from liberty of london and design and make the products themselves.
Female:99.75%, Female, i love the atmosphere the olympics are stirring up in my city. i love how i can get downtown after a 20 minute bus ride and experience granville street at its best. the colours, smells, sounds and feelings of patriotism breathes vancouver new life. nightlife is more expensive, but hey, it's a great time to be barely legal. with the exception of day one (and today), our city has been enjoying some of the best weather it's seen in february. things haven't been perfect though. with the tragic death of the georgian luger on day 1, the untimely death of canadian figure skater joannie rochette's mother, unseasonal, warm weather, the disappointment of some canadian medal hopefuls...and not to mention the failure to bring the fourth pillar up for the opening ceremonies (lol, fail) we've been good sports. we're handling it well. the enthusiasm for the games is contagious. 
Male:100.00%, Male, monetary values change as consciousness changes. prosperity consciousness is higher consciousness because it is an expansion of the projection of the individual mind unto infinity and that is the reason why yogi bhajan taught us for the first ten years about meditation and yoga to help us heal ourselves, physically and mentally and then he started teaching us prosperity consciousness because it becomes more obviously important for one to become prosperous materially as one progresses spiritually. yogi bhajan was such a master that he was able to teach us the importance of this. if you look at any other spiritual discipline, you may or may not find this. as spritually aware people who are also conscious of our physical health we must balance all aspects of life. that is what yoga means to find the balance in all things. 
Female:99.99%, Male, …and as the rain fell brilliantly against my window on a saturday afternoon i noticed a pattern within the glitter of the rain drops. the pattern was of a face that i recognized as life and we stared at each other. we wanted to see who would be the first to blink and neither of us wanted to be the first one to give in. what i noticed in life’s eyes were my many sacrifices as i have had to hurdle the jump ropes of reality in order to live dreams without having to close my eyes. and in this life, my life, i have suffered to be able to smile; i have cried to be able to enjoy my fate. acceptance is our greatest sacrifice i’ve come to learn because until we accept our challenges we aren’t able to come up with a game plan to reach our goals or to stimulate our own identity.
Male:99.96%, Male, that's the second book in timothy zahn's trilogy. i bet y'all thought that i'd forgotten about you concerning our fun trips. i realize that it's been a while since our vacation, but i might as well post the pictures that i was planning. the delay has been caused by our village missions conference and my presence here at zachary and brenda's house. hopefully i'll be able to post some pictures of this fun soonish, but until then, without further ado, the unveiling of our seaworld pictures. i'm a big fan of the orcas. they are much more majestic than their cousins: regulation orcs. i was pretty sure, beforehand, that whaling was illegal in most states these days, but i certainly enjoyed my portion. there's a likelihood that i was a bigger fan of the belugas than of anything else. for whatever reason, the all-white whales (or the all-black pilot whales which i have no pictures of) just greatly entertain me. perchance my monochromatic preferences reflect my worldview? here's a good pic of emily and her grandma looking at said whales. 
Female:96.85%, Female, "weird" let's discuss what this word means to us. to me it's one of the most positive words i know. i think i generally use it to replace "interesting" but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him "weird" was a massive compliment, i realized i might be alone in this. i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre. things i don't quite understand but that none the less, peak my interest. i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face, i get the oddest looks. i also tend to take it as a compliment when i'm called "weird", even though i'm sure it's often not meant that way :) google image "weird" and this is the first thing that comes up. see how great it is? 
Male:100.00%, Male, there are two types of fall guys; one who willingly accepts responsibility for something he didn't do, to cover for those that did. and then, there's the other, who gets blame for it, because the one who actually did it, doesn't want to be held responsible for it. either way, someone at the end is left holding the bag while the bad guy gets away. truth of the matter is, fall guys can be found in all walks of life. in the corporate world, in the politics of washington, in the world of espionage, love triangles and even mostly in the world of organized crime. sometimes fall guys are not just about one, but about many. that’s because in this so-called fault game, the notion becomes many and the more the many, the more confusing. the more confusing, the more difficult it becomes to find the truth. who to blame and who to be held accounted for. we live in a world of good versus evil. the fall guy is made out to be evil. when reality tell us that evil doesn't really exist. because good prevails all and evil is simply a lack of. evil becomes our creation. and in the end, its really all about us. since we are to blame for its existence. so in the end there is and always will be a fall guy. when the finger is pointed at who? it should always be pointed at us. 
Female:100.00%, Female, i like...flipping my blankets over to the cold side when i sleep, the smell of sun-dried laundry, back scratches, food, the winter's first snowfall, beach days, wallowing in music on a gloomy, wet vancouver day, crazy moments with people that i am crazy for, nail polish, avocados, big warm hugs, large meadows that are frolick-a-ble, the summertime, qoola, french, leggings, tea, metal water bottles, school supply shopping, salmon cream cheese, and some days more than others - stepping out of my comfort zone.
Female:100.00%, Male, alone for so long walking down the path of darkness with a lamp to guide my journey of life, the fates gust by the light goes out and i stand alone in the darkness wondering why.i continue to walk down the path not seeing anything but shadows and figures that speak of evil of man. i pray and hope for an angel to walk with me as a guide and friend, soon in the midst of the darkness a glow begins, a path is laid before me showing me a place to call home. as i walk down this path i come upon a woman with a bright smile that let's my heart know all will be good. at first she was a stranger who offered nothing but kindness and love. my angel shares her heart and pain with me as we walk beside each other on this path. i never knew of such kindness and love, a mother’s love i never known the scars and fears that led to the dark path i took. slowly the angel became my best friend and mother. thankful for the blessings and kindness she gave to me. through are pains together she has loved and stood by me, its fate that the woman who lost her son found one and the son who never had a mother found his. the path is brighter and easier now that my mother angel is with me .i has found peace in my life through the love and friendship of another who was hurt and lost likes i. my mother angel is my guardian, my keeper, my mother and best friend. i thank god for the blessings i have in this path i take. my biggest blessing is the mother i've found to me that's the greatest gift of all. 
Female:100.00%, Female, it's been more than a month since i posted anything here. there is so much to do, plus my mood has been off. but i am finding myself really missing the journaling aspect of blogging, especially therapeutic journaling. blogger, heal thyself! i have a week's (unpaid) vacation from my job, and today i am cleaning house as i work on my to-do list. sewing, decorating, and gardening are how i would most like to spend this time. more moving-in and organizing have to be on the plan as well. some priorities are (bleh!) taxes and fencing (*sigh*) to keep the boy dogs from fighting. dunno why, but i did not expect this!! harley is not the simple laid-back, big squishy teddy bear he appears to be, and has now decided to make his move for dominance. or is it his intention to completely eliminate the competition? i can't tell. as he grew much larger than frankie, he began to show a little more aggression in regard to being close to his people and being first for treats. less than a week after his neutering, we had an incident over a collar and leash they both wanted (to them, these evidently mean being singled out for special treatment) and ended up with a badly wounded frankie, and also a wounded mama (me). poking your finger into a fighting st. bernard's mouth is not the best idea for breaking his hold. four days later my fingers on the other hand were also injured and frankie's wounds were opened, and i learned that this was not something we were going to be able to put behind us for a long time, if ever. one of the happiest parts of my daily life has been sharing it with my three dogs, so you can imagine how bummed i am feeling. at all times, one of them must be either outside, in the laundry room, or in the crate. coordinating their quality time inside and out is very unsatisfying for all and very time-consuming for me. we did find a really good article on this type of aggression, which has given us some hope, and our next plan is to install a good gate in the middle of the house and to create a separation of yards outside. otherwise, we will have to find harley a new home where he can be the only dog, without competition for affection and attention. damn. 
Male:99.16%, Male, it was a scavenger style race with checkpoints throughout boston and the surrounding neighborhoods. at each checkpoint you would be given a task to perform "find 5 pounds of stuff, carry it to the finish," "find 10 pounds of stuff," "find something that cant fit into this envelope" etc etc. the idea was that by the end of the race we and our bikes would be covered in random objects and whoever had the most interesting stuff and the most stuff by the end of the race would win a prize. in the end, i finished the race 7/52 racers in about 3 hours with 40lbs of crap on me--which turned out to be good but not nearly enough to beat the eventual winner, joshua, with an amazing 100lbs of junk hauled in on his cargo bike. the race was followed with a bbq and bike games, all in all a very fun time that i hope to repeat again in a few weeks at the next race! 
Female:100.00%, Female, finally! i got a full day's work done. almost 4k, and if my hand hadn't started hurting i would have gotten even more done. there's nothing i hate more than wanting to go go go and my body won't let me. grr. but i'm finally past the three-quarter mark on hecate's own and i'm about to write the big showdown, save-the-day scene, after which there will be food, sex, and more food, knowing zach. once that's done, it's time for the meat grinder and the beta readers while i switch gears and begin serious work on norwegian wood. i keep thinking i'm missing something, though. something important. hopefully it will come out in the meat grinder and i'll slap myself silly, fix it and move on. if not, my betas will find it, slap me silly, and i'll fix it and move on. i haven't gotten the artwork yet on mating games, and i'm still waiting for word on noble blood, but i knew i would be. laurie was swamped with red hot fairy tale submissions, so for everyone who's waiting to hear the fate of duncan, jaden and moira hopefully i'll have word no later than the end of april. oh! and if you've emailed me and i haven't responded, please email me again! i've been so caught up i may have missed it. our oldest graduates grade school this year, we're planning a trip to disney and i've got rt coming up, so when i'm able to sit at the computer i've been concentrating a lot on that stuff since writing wasn't much of an option the last few weeks. i know. bad author. no cookie for me. p.s. samhain publishing is hosting the second annual sammie awards at the samhain cafe this sunday! i'll be there if i have to sit dusty down and make him type for me! hope to see you there! 
Male:100.00%, Male, at the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. ~jean houston when people are laughing, they're generally not killing each other. ~alan alda i am creating this blog in pursuit to put more laughter in the world. not only will i post my own original parodies, but i will also introduce you to other parody creators. i will introduce you to parodies in all forms—songs, video clips, stories, and books. stick around and i promise you’ll get a good laugh. mostly, i will be posting parodies that i made up in this blog. from time to time, i may review other parodies, parody writers, videos making fun of others, etc. before i post a parody, i will first explain how the parody came to me. often, it takes some time to explain, but it’s sometimes interesting to hear how my imagination works. also, i know that if you have to explain the meanings of “jokes” and what not, that means that they aren’t funny. but there will be sometimes that i will want to explain certain parts of my parodies; a phrase, a verse or two.
Male:100.00%, Male, i like birds, especially woodpeckers and most especially the huge campephilus woodpeckers. four years ago i started a photo group on flickr called ivory-billed woodpeckers and others in the campephilus genus by posting a few photos that i took of a pale-billed woodpecker in belize. the illustrious ivory-billed woodpecker is a member of the genus. there are many others too, with far smaller claims to fame, with words like cream-backed, crimson-crested, magellanic, powerful, and robust in names that suit their unique brilliance. our group recently surpassed 1,000 photos contributed by many individuals - a real milestone! now this site becomes another way to celebrate these birds. 
Female:100.00%, Female, oh friends, it's finally here! i thought the month between christmas break and midwinter break wouldn't be too slow and awful. i told myself i wouldn't take any days off, and i succeeded in that. there was a pretty rough stretch for a bit, though, with that bunch of teachers leaving. loud leo left our class a few weeks ago. a new boy came to the class, but has apparently left again. buster, whom i have not yet mentioned, has remained a serious detriment to the class's focus and my patience (or lack thereof). buster refuses to control himself most of the time. it's 'just' his mouth, but that means that when the rest of the class is quiet, he makes noise and distracts them and then never shuts up. and then other boys follow his lead and make more noise. gah. he's really started to haunt me. we had a party on friday, that i'm not totally certain they deserved, but lord knows it had to be better than trying to force them to learn on the friday afternoon before a week off. our last lesson of the day was writing valentine acrostics. about half of kids basically did nothing, but the rest did a poem, and a few of them turned out pretty well actually. anyway....we're here! vacation! a whole week off! my favorite part is always the not waking up before dawn. also the not being at school for so many hours. i didn't bring anything home with me, but i will go in for a few hours next week to work on unit planning. i've been behind for so long but too exhausted to do anything about it. i hope to remedy that, at least a little for now. also, happy valentine's day today! the boy and i had a wonderful day together, out and about.
